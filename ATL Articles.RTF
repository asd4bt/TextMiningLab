\f3\fs20 \cf0 ST. MARYS --- Georgia's wildlife agency minced no words recently in declaring 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  "a threat inherent with uncertainty," perhaps the state's starkest warning ever on a politically sensitive subject dismissed by many elected officials.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Here, though, on Georgia's 100-mile-long coast, most everybody takes seriously rising seas and dying marshes caused by drastic 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the Earth's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . They live already with the proof: greater tidal surges; flooded roads; and ages-old trees killed by salt water creeping further inland.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 If the dire predictions of state, federal and university scientists prove true, then billions of dollars of property in Brunswick, Darien, St. Marys and Savannah and on the islands of St. Simons, Sea and Tybee will be under water within a century.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Much of the coast's ecologically critical salt marsh will die off. Upland streams will turn brackish. Sparrows and shrimp will disappear if, as predicted, the Atlantic Ocean rises an additional 3 feet by 2110.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "No matter if you believe 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is natural or man-made, sea levels are rising and it behooves us to know how to plan and respond," said Clark Alexander, the director of the Applied Coastal Research Laboratory on Skidaway Island. "If we don't start preparing now, it will become a bigger problem later."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia has no grand plan to combat 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  or its effects. State leaders ignore, sidestep or downplay 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  warnings. Most remain unconvinced of man's role in Earth's warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Gov. Nathan Deal, wouldn't answer questions about the governor's views on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . U.S. Sen. David Perdue, a Republican who lives on Sea Island, a barrier island threatened by rising seas, said "the scientific community is not in total agreement about whether mankind has been a contributing factor."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "That's why we must find an appropriate balance between responsibly protecting the environment and continuing to develop our abundance of natural resources in order to grow the economy and improve people's quality of life," he added in a statement.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 David Stooksbury, the former state climatologist, said the unwillingness of leaders to address 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is dangerous.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I don't think that most of our elected officials understand the long-term seriousness of what 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  will do to the agricultural economy, public health and the environment," he said. "It will be much cheaper and better for the state if we follow a well-developed plan starting now rather than waiting until we must respond."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some steps underway
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 President Barack Obama last week unveiled a major 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  plan that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by one-third by 2030. His edict, which met with widespread scorn from many conservatives and others who discount 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , follows repeated scientific warnings that the Earth is getting hotter. Some states are suing to block the White House ruling; Georgia has yet to take action.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last year was the warmest since 1880, according to NASA, and the 10 hottest years recorded (with one exception, 1998) have all occurred since 2000. James Hansen, NASA's former lead 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientist, and 16 co-authors reported last month that glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica will melt 10 times faster than previously estimated. If true, sea levels are projected to rise at least 10 feet within 50 years.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A hotter planet melts icebergs and causes ocean water to warm and expand, fueling the rise of the world's seas and making coastal communities nervous. St. Marys, in Georgia's southeastern corner and surrounded by rivers, creeks and marsh, is precariously perched 10 feet above sea level.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "No one really knows the projected impact of sea rise," said John Holman, the city's manager. "Everyone is trying to understand it. It needs more study. For us, it's an important issue."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that a 3-foot rise in sea level would inundate St. Marys' historic district with its majestic oaks, white picket fences and 1808 Presbyterian church with an iron bell cast by Paul Revere.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Two years ago, the feds put up most of the cost of a $160,000 study intended to alert St. Marys to the potential dangers of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . A report, which will detail the costs associated with protecting the city from surging seas, is expected any day.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 St. Marys isn't waiting. The City Council voted three years ago to raise the height of first floors in buildings constructed in flood plains. It's considering raising walkways at new municipal buildings to allow water to seep into the ground and not pool or flood. Officials are also weighing an enterprise fund just for stormwater projects. And the city's 2030 strategic plan will likely emphasize rising seas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Sea-level rise will be costly, if the projections are accurate, for the city to prepare for," Holman said. "But, by working in advance, we'll get a head start. We'll take precautionary measures."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He added, "I believe we're in better shape than Tybee Island."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As much as two-thirds of the popular beach town near Savannah would disappear by 2110 if NOAA's sea-level predictions hold true.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It's good to see the state agency charged with protecting Georgia's environment catching up with the military in factoring 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  into long-range plans," said Paul Wolff, a Tybee councilman. "As a resident of a community on the front lines of sea-level rise, I believe every level of government needs to be proactive in reducing, planning for and adapting to the effects of a 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last month the wildlife resources division of the Department of Natural Resources issued its State Wildlife Action Plan, or SWAP, which states unequivocally that "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  presents unprecedented challenges." The federal government requires states to submit a SWAP every 10 years or risk losing conservation money for at-risk fish and wildlife. Georgia received $1.2 million the past fiscal year.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is impacting species and habitats, and these effects are projected to increase substantially over time," the SWAP says. "These 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone -driven 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  will profoundly affect our ability to conserve fish and wildlife and their habitats."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The first SWAP, issued in 2005, mentioned 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and global warming, but it said "local effects are often difficult to quantify." Then-Gov. Sonny Perdue followed up a year later with a State Energy Strategy, which stated that "strong scientific evidence exists that increasing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG) are affecting Earth's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ." The 138-page report, with three pages devoted to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , listed potential dangers and recommended that the state inventory carbon dioxide emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 South viewed at risk
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A tidal gauge off Fort Pulaski near Tybee has tracked the slow but steady rise --- 11 inches over the past 80 years --- of the Atlantic Ocean. The sea began rising dramatically in the 1990s. 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists now predict an additional 40-inch surge by 2110.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Every storm that comes ashore will intrude further inland and will become more dangerous, and we will have more days of nuisance flooding," said Alexander of the University of Georgia's Skidaway Institute below Savannah, where scientists study marine and environmental sciences.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia Tech researchers estimate that 30 percent, or 419 square miles, of Chatham, Liberty and McIntosh counties will be under water by 2110 if the sea keeps rising at its current rate. Georgia's barrier islands will be swamped, and some coastal towns will experience billions of dollars of damage to municipal infrastructure --- road, water and sewer --- and private property.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Man, though, can adapt. The natural world may take it on the chin as salt water pushes further inland into fresh water. Two-thirds of Georgia's saltwater marsh system --- an ecologically critical habitat for fish and wildlife --- could disappear.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "You have a whole host of species dependent on that salt marsh environment," said Jason Lee, a DNR coastal expert who helped write the SWAP's 11-page section on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . "The food web would collapse. Marsh birds would have to seek habitat elsewhere. Shrimp and crabs would be affected. Sea turtles would also be a primary concern, (as) would several shorebirds that nest and forage along the coast. You could see significant ecosystem impacts."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Hotter weather, droughts and more frequent and intense downpours will make an impact on the natural environment statewide, the SWAP reports, and harm North Georgia habitats for mountain brook trout and patch-nosed salamanders. Rising temperatures --- some estimates predict an 8- to 20-degree increase in future Julys --- would allow invasive species such as kudzu, gypsy moths and feral hogs to spread further north.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It's a really good sign that the state of Georgia is recognizing and planning for the impact of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," said Jennette Gayer, the director of Environment Georgia. "This is a great first step, and I hope to see more forward-thinking reports like this to really plan for the future."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Other state agencies and universities have also sounded the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  alarm. The website for the DNR's coastal resources division says that "the Earth's 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is one of coastal Georgia's greatest environmental challenges." A 2012 Georgia Ports Authority presentation listed the impact of rising seas on the docks and terminals.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 UGA's agriculture extension agency educates farmers about the risks of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . The university's Sea Grant program steers federal and state money to coastal communities, including Tybee and St. Marys, preparing for rising seas, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and other threats.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Georgia Initiative for 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and Society, a network of UGA scientists, including Marshall Shepherd, seeks to better understand the threats posed by a warming 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Shepherd, who runs the university's Atmospheric Sciences Program, says the South is particularly vulnerable to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 All the warnings, though, have failed to translate into concerted and meaningful action by Georgia leaders.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Many skeptics among leadership
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The governor hasn't crafted an energy strategy as his predecessor did. The 2006 carbon registry proposal is dead. State senators passed a resolution in 2012 urging Congress to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from further regulating greenhouse gases without more research on carbon dioxide's impact on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 States, though, must take 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  seriously or risk losing hundreds of millions of federal dollars.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia is one of nine states that doesn't mention 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in federally required disaster mitigation plans. It has until 2019 to comply. But, starting next year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will only give money to states with plans that address 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Through 2012, according to the Center for 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Law, Georgia had received about $180 million in FEMA grants to help buy land vulnerable to flooding as well as other prevention measures.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The SWAP recommends a slew of research and conservation measures to combat 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  over the next decade. Sea turtles, saltmarsh sparrows, Nelson's sparrows and right whales should be further monitored and protected.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Butterfly and migratory bird habitats within utility corridors should be upgraded. The northern march of kudzu and gypsy moths should be halted. Large swaths of the Altamaha River corridor, and other vulnerable waterways, should be joined and protected to allow unfettered migration of animals. Streams and wetlands should be further buffered.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It's questionable, though, whether state and federal officials will put up the money to help a warming planet.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "By not having a comprehensive 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  plan and following it, Georgians, in the long run, will be spending more to adapt," said Stooksbury, the state's former climatologist who was fired by Deal in 2011. "I am not very hopeful that these 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  will be made until is it painfully obvious."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Deal, like many Georgia politicians, takes a half-pregnant position on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Most don't deny that the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , yet they question whether the problem is man-made. Deal says it's a federal, not state, issue. Yet, he passed on an opportunity in September to slam the EPA over efforts to curb power plant emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The chairmen of the state House and Senate committees that craft environmental and energy policies blame nature, not man, for the projected surge in temperatures and sea levels.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We should understand that Mother Nature is the lead power in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," said state Sen. Ross Tolleson, the chairman of the Natural Resources and Environment Committee.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 State Rep. Don Parsons, the chairman of the House Energy Committee and a Marietta Republican, said "there's always a point when you have to ask about what doing more will cost the state of Georgia."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some coastal lawmakers also question the urgency to do something about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I, for one, don't see it as being a serious problem," said Barry Brown, a Tybee city councilman. "Sometimes these things just get brought up to get people in a panic to buy something. Whether or not they have the facts to back it up, I haven't seen any."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia hasn't gone as far as neighboring states in dismissing 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Florida Gov. Rick Scott reportedly ordered government officials in March not to use the term in reports or press releases. In 2012, the North Carolina Legislature imposed a four-year moratorium on state rules, plans or policies based on expected 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in sea level.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, like Perdue, cites "mixed scientific evidence" about the origins of Earth's warming. While both senators acknowledged in January that "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is not a hoax," they also opposed legislation linking 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  temperatures to human activity. Each takes a conservative, pro-business position that carbon dioxide regulations will hamper business.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We all care about the environment," Isakson said on the floor of the Senate in March. "We just don't all subscribe to the same theory about what happens."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Wolff, the Tybee councilman and environmentalist, says politicians in Washington and Atlanta need to embrace the dangers of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , regardless of who's at fault, before it's too late.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It's unfortunate that they don't seem to understand the urgency we're facing on the coast," he said. "They should be doing a lot more to (fight) 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . The science is irrefutable. It isn't hypothetical to us. It's real life."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 A few months into the 2020 presidential campaign, the environment is emerging as one of the most discussed issues on the campaign trail. Six in 10 Americans are concerned or alarmed about global warming, according to researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities, and presidential hopefuls are taking notice.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Candidates have rolled out significant 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  policy proposals, and although this week a panel of the Democratic National Committee denied a presidential debate devoted to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , CNN and MSNBC will host town halls on the topic in September.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As debate surrounding the issue has evolved, so have the words used to describe it.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Years ago before scientists knew what human impact would mean for the planet, they called it "inadvertent 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  modification." Now, environmental activists and some lawmakers say the planet is in trouble, and they're calling it a crisis.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As knowledge and understanding of the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  have deepened, so has the desire to give the topic a more accurate label -- and possibly engage voters from both major political parties.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This spring when Spark Neuro, a company which monitors brain and nervous system activity to measure how people are feeling, tested words for environmental 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , "
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  crisis" rose to the top. Gut reactions to "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone " showed the term to be innocuous. "Global warming"was deemed alarmist. Neither term elicited emotional reactions from Democrats or Republicans. 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  crisis, however, "could strike a bipartisan chord as a more reasonable observation," said the survey results. "To reframe the issue is to engage unconvinced voters, and ... '
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  crisis' may hit the sweet spot."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The words are a reflection of personal politics, said linguistic and political experts, but it is unclear whether 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  terminology equals action, specifically among the unconvinced.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I think the 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in terminology probably creates better headlines, but I don't think it is 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  policy much," said Andrew Pieper, associate professor of political science at Kennesaw State University. "It is probably even hurting politicians because they have this huge incentive to avoid the language their opponents use."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Words matter, and what we say conveys our attitude toward what we are talking about, said Sarah Blackwell, professor of linguistics at the University of Georgia. "Very rarely are words neutral. They are typically positively or negatively nuanced in some way," she said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Inadvertent 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  modification" never really took off, for obvious reasons. Scientists would later use "global warming" to describe surface temperature increases due to rising levels of greenhouse gases. They used "climatic 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone " or "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone " to describe longterm 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in Earth's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , which include global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For decades, despite its limitations, "global warming" was the term of choice in popular culture. Then in 2002, Republican strategist Frank Luntz suggested President George W. Bush use only the term "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It was less ominous sounding, Luntz said. And it was a term supported by the scientific community, including NASA which uses the term "global 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone " in communications.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But words weren't the only thing 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . In the 1990s, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  policies had been largely bipartisan, said politicians.A decade later, those policies had become partisan issues and the words a candidate or lawmaker used to talk about them became part of their personal branding.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We used to think of culture wars and identity politics as only being about gender mores and traditional family values, but as the parties have become more ideologically split, every policy debate is potentially identity politics," said Pieper of Kennesaw State.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "In Washington they argue over the semantics," said Jason Buelterman, mayor of Tybee Island. "All I can say is that from my perspective as a local official on a barrier island that is low to the sea, we have experienced the effects of sea level rise and we are dealing with it, regardless of what they do in Washington."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It's hard to say how "
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  crisis" originated. Al Gore was already making references to a crisis when his 2006 documentary "An Inconvenient Truth" was released. Environmental advocacy groups were also attaching more urgency to the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  conversation by using words that would serve as a call to action. Earlier this year, Gore's 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Reality Project launched an online petition asking news organizations to make the switch.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In May, the Guardian updated its style guide to include "
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  crisis" as the preferred term over "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But some local politicians say altering the course of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  will require much more than new terminology.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I don't need fancy talk," said state Rep. Al Williams, D-Midway, a self-proclaimed Gullah Geechee from coastal Georgia. "It is a crisis because unfortunately politics has become so divided and so partisan.We need to sit down in a bipartisan effort and get back to doing what we did and make sure we survive and leave something for the next generation."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 With the elections fast upon us, I urge readers to vote yes for a small increase in sales tax to give MARTA the support it deserves. I ride MARTA frequently, but even if one chooses not to ride MARTA, we will all benefit from improved air quality and less traffic congestion. Many people must rely on MARTA to get to work, doctor appointments, etc. For them, MARTA is most important. But all of the Atlanta area benefits when citizens are able to get to employment. Many of us who prefer to take MARTA find it so much easier and less expensive than driving and parking. We must reduce carbon pollution as quickly as possible -- for our personal health and the health of the planet. We need legislation for a carbon fee with dividend, but we can reduce our carbon footprint right now by using MARTA.

\f3\fs20 Donald Trump brags on camera about his exploits against women and many of these women have now come forward to tell their "Trump" story. What does the Republican candidate have to say? "I didn't do it. How can you believe those people?" is his response. In the next breath, he sticks to his story that the Central Park Five are guilty of rape regardless of the evidence showing their innocence. He says, "But they confessed on the interrogation tapes!" He doesn't take into consideration that those confessions were coerced, that there was never any evidence to convict and that the real rapist was later caught. So, in the case of five young men falsely accused, Trump says, "Look at the tape!" yet in his own video where he admits wrongful actions, he shouts, "The tape is not me!" You can't have it both ways, Donald, and neither can those who defend you.

\f3\fs20 The global warming crowd likes to try to discredit skeptics like myself by calling us "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  deniers." They are not being honest with that characterization, however, because we are not denying that the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . The 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  has always been 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  for millions of years. The thing we are skeptical about is that the feeble efforts of mankind have the ability to stop it from 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Forty years ago, we were told that we were headed for a new ice age. When that didn't happen, they 
\f1\i\b \ul changed
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  their prediction to radical warming of the planet. Over time, that was not supported by the data, so they 
\f1\i\b \ul changed
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  their warning to the ambiguous "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ." None of their predictions have come true, and the global warming alarmists are rapidly losing their credibility. The recent desperate attempts to criminalize skeptics have made many more people question the global warming scam.

\f3\fs20 Jay Bookman points out how 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  concerns have been ignored in this year's campaigns ( "The Crisis," Opinion, Oct. 23). He is correct that the issue is the most important one for our children and grandchildren. Granted, there are many potential, important issues to be discussed but few are of such importance to our grandchildren as that of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . It is very unfortunate that many politicians focus on short-term needs rather than the potential future catastrophe. More unfortunate is the huge procrastination penalty with the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  issue. The longer we wait to do something, the exponentially greater the cost will be. We can't just "turn off" 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Although I will not, the additional greenhouse gasses we put into the atmosphere will be around for hundreds of years. So, sorry grandchildren, some of us tried to do something, but most of us just didn't care about you.

\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  --- another issue that has divided Democrats and Republicans in recent years and should continue to generate some interesting claims to test on the Truth-O-Meter.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Rick Perry: Scientists are "questioning the original idea that manmade global warming is what is causing the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  to 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . ... (It is) more and more being put into question."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Republican governor from Texas has made it clear he doesn't believe that human beings are contributing to global warming, and he expounded on the issue in detail at a stop in New Hampshire during his short run for president in the 2012 race.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 PolitiFact asked the Perry campaign for comment on this, but we didn't hear back. In response to similar questions from The Washington Post, the Perry campaign pointed to various writings questioning 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . But the Post's report noted these writings were anecdotal and "not evidence of the groundswell of opposition suggested by Perry."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 PolitiFact reviewed several reports on the subject. Each concluded that the emissions of greenhouse gases from human activity were a factor in global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences --- the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences --- found that out of 1,372 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  researchers under review, approximately 97 percent to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Perry's remarks give the impression that the science of global warming is in dispute, that some scientists feel one way, and some scientists feel another way. He says that skepticism is growing. In fact, our research shows that's not the case. PolitiFact found that there is solid consensus among the major scientific organizations and that the skeptics seem to be a small minority. PolitiFact rated his statement False.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Barack Obama says Texas wildfires are linked to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Obama ridiculed Texas Gov. Rick Perry in a September 2011 speech when the president said, "You've got a governor whose state is on fire denying 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A White House spokesman defended Obama's remarks, saying there is a link between severe weather and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Historically, scientists have drawn a clear distinction between specific weather events and longer-range 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , and that sentiment persists. The situation in Texas that Obama was referring to could be described as something broader than a specific weather event, and there is peer-reviewed evidence linking broader 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the American Southwest with the incidence of wildfires in the region.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Texas state climatologist wrote around that time he believes 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  has had an effect in encouraging the current wildfires, but only as a modest contributing factor. This caution, combined with the difficulty of determining cause and effect in a system as complex as the Earth's atmosphere, led PolitiFact to rate Obama's claim Half True.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Tim Pawlenty: "The weight of the evidence (on global warming) is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it's fair to say the science is in dispute."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor who was briefly in the race for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, made these comments to The Miami Herald.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 PolitiFact divided his statement into two parts:
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 1) Evidence points toward 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  being primarily a natural, rather than manmade, phenomenon.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 2) The science about the causes of global 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is in dispute.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Based on our research, there is very little dispute in the scientific community, especially among 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  specialists, on whether 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is primarily caused by natural or manmade forces. The majority of scientists polled feel human activity is the primary driver of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Based on scientific studies, global warming over the past 50 years has been primarily driven by human activity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Pawlenty's claims are both incorrect and misleading to the public, who may not be familiar with the science behind 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . It is not "fair to say the science is in dispute," as if there are good arguments on both sides. Rather, there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming. We rated his statement False.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Florida Wildlife Federation: Claims Ohio Gov. John Kasich says 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is a problem.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The federation posted billboards around Tampa shortly before the 2012 Republican National Convention with this claim to boost their argument that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is a concern among some Republican leaders as well as Democrats.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 PolitiFact checked with Kasich's staff to see whether the quote was accurate. Rob Nichols, the governor's spokesman, confirmed that it was taken from a speech Kasich made in May 2012 at a small energy conference in Columbus, Ohio.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But for context, Nichols said there is a little more to Kasich's thoughts on global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "He has said this several times, but what is usually omitted is what is on the back-end of what he has said," Nichols said. "Each time he says it, he has added, 'How big is this? I don't know. Should we overreact to this? No.'"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 \cf0 If there is a silver lining to the failure of the Copenhagen 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  accords to produce a legally binding treaty on global warming, it is this: instituting a robust and lasting agreement a year from now is a more desirable outcome than instituting a weak agreement today.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But what variables might 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the near term that could give rise to more favorable conditions for a binding and effective agreement on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 One important shift under way is the growing recognition that greenhouse gas reductions are not the only option we have to slow and ultimately reverse global warming. Restoring and expanding global forests can also cool the planet.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While such a declaration may constitute heresy in a political and scientific arena in which 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and the greenhouse effect have come to be understood as one and the same, global warming is not driven by greenhouse gases alone.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It is also driven by the quantity of heat that is emitted from the Earth's surface and ultimately absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The phenomenon of global warming can be likened to a pot of boiling water: placing a lid over the pot traps outgoing heat energy and raises the temperature inside, but turning up the burner under the pot also raises temperature, quite independent of the placement of the lid.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The extensive loss of forest and other vegetative cover across the Earth's surface is significantly increasing the quantity of heat emitted to the atmosphere, contributing in turn to a rise in temperature.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 How significant is the role of global land surface 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  compared to the role of greenhouse gases in bringing about global warming?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A review of the now extensive scientific literature on land use and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  appearing in the journal Science concludes that land use 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and greenhouse gas emissions may be contributing to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in equal parts.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At the scale of the planet as a whole, the influence of deforestation on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  can be hard to discern, as deforestation in one region of the planet can be offset by reforestation in another.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But when measured at the regional to sub-continental scale, the impacts of land use on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  have been shown to be roughly equivalent to the effects of greenhouse gases on temperature.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At the scale of cities, where most of the global population now lives and where approximately 80 percent of greenhouse gases are emitted, land use has a much more pronounced effect on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  than greenhouse gases, contributing to rates of warming that are often double that of the planet as a whole.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In urbanized areas such as Atlanta, land use strategies emphasizing tree planting and the use of reflective building materials are far more likely to lower temperatures over the coming decades than greenhouse gas reductions alone.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Recognition of the direct and significant influence global forests have on temperature, distinct from the more modest benefits forests provide in the form of carbon sequestration, is a potential game changer in the realm of international 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  policy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At present, a principal obstacle to reaching an agreement concerns the limited ability of developing nations to ratchet down carbon emissions from the fossil intensive industries needed to propel their economies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Yet, many of these same developing nations are home to the globally significant forest ecosystems most in need of protection and regeneration.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Formal recognition of the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone -regulating benefits of forests in international cap and trade programs would create a new mechanism for nations to trade forest regeneration credits in concert with carbon reduction credits.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Developing economies would benefit from a new revenue stream that could be used to modernize industry and reduce emissions; developed economies would benefit from increased flexibility in meeting treaty obligations. And the planet would benefit from having both the land surface and atmospheric drivers of global warming mitigated.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The good news is that global scientists are increasingly aware of the significance of land use to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A report of contributing scientists to the Intergovernmental Panel on 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  (IPCC) published in advance of the Copenhagen conference acknowledges for the first time the direct, non-emissions related influence of global deforestation on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and calls for future IPCC assessments to account for such 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  models.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This is a first step toward a more comprehensive approach to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . The next step is for 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  treaty negotiators to work in the post-Copenhagen period to develop a new international framework for managing 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , one that capitalizes on the benefits of global forest regeneration for 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  mitigation in concert with emissions reductions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Such an approach not only makes use of the full array of management tools available to us but also lays the groundwork for a grand bargain between developed and developing economies and, in so doing, provides a promising way forward from Copenhagen.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Brian Stone is a professor of Environmental Planning at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His latest research on land use and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  appears this month in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 The government's top public health agency has canceled a February conference on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and health but isn't saying why publicly.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But a co-sponsor was told by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the agency was worried how the conference would be viewed by the Trump administration.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In an email response to a request from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a CDC spokeswoman wrote that three days before Christmas, the agency began telling registered participants the February 2017 summit would be postponed. :
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We are exploring options to reschedule the meeting while considering budget priorities for fiscal year 2017," the Atlanta-based agency wrote in an official statement. It would also look for "potential overlap with an APHA (American Public Health Association) conference on the same topic also being held later in 2017."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The incoming administration did not ask or order that the meeting be canceled, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "They had no idea or not whether the new administration would be supportive," said Benjamin, whose group was a co-sponsor of the event with the CDC.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rather, the decision was "a strategic retreat," intended to head off a possible last-minute cancellation or other repercussions from Trump officials who may prove hostile to spending money on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  science, Benjamin said Monday.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "They decided the better part of valor was to stop and regroup" until it could be discussed with Trump's new health leadership, Benjamin said. A new CDC director has not been named.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Benjamin called the decision understandable but worrisome. He was echoed by Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was invited to speak at the conference.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "In the long run, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is affecting the health of Americans," she said. "At some point, I hope they will go forward with the conference."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Ian Karra, an organizer for the Sierra Club, said the move to cancel the summit was "deeply disturbing."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The Trump administration has a responsibility to take 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  seriously," Karra said. "If the CDC is taking this step preemptively, we hope it will show some 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  courage going forward."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Public health experts say 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is a man-made problem that contributes to a range of health issues and illnesses, including heat stroke and diseases spread by tropical insects. The CDC has a $10 million program on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and health, and published guidelines to help local health officials deal with human vulnerability to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In 2012, Trump tweeted that the concept of global warming was created by the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. He later said he was joking, but during the presidential campaign referred to global warming as "a hoax."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Before he took office, Trump met with former Vice President Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio, both prominent 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  activists. Trump picked Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. During his confirmation hearing, Pruitt backed away from his own past statements and said 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is real.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 On a recent Monday, just days after school started, sixth graders at Samuel M. Inman Middle School in Atlanta shifted in their seats as earth science teacher Spence Ford slid a finger across the whiteboard, moving the image of an ice capped glacier to reveal a brown mass of earth. The dramatic depiction of the death of Okjokull, memorialized by environmental advocates Aug. 18 as the first glacier in Iceland lost to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , captured their attention.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "What is the point of having a funeral for a nonliving glacier?" Ford asked.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It is a message to the future that global warming is going to get worse, and we need to do something about it," said one student.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Within minutes, his students had moved on to the day's assigned task, but Ford was pleased with the detour. "I am very intentional about bringing up 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and social justice in the curriculum, but I don't always know how I'm going to do it or when I'm going to do it," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As students across the metro area settle into a new school year, teachers like Ford continue to search for ways to bring conversations about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  into their classrooms. Young people are playing an increasingly prominent role in environmental activism, from the worldwide student walkouts inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg to Zero Hour, the youth-led organization that trains youths to take action around 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While 79% of adult Georgians believe schools should teach about the causes, consequences and potential solutions to global warming, according to a 2018 survey from the Yale Program on 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Communication, young people may leave school lacking the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  literacy they need as the next generation of CEOs, managers and employees of global companies, some educators said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Science textbooks may be outdated or lack information, and some teachers may not have the time or the training to bring in outside resources. In a National Center for Science Education survey of teachers from the 2014-15 school year, fewer than 50% of teachers said they had formal coursework in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , and two-thirds were interested in professional development in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  science. Teachers may also face resistance from parents or communities for teaching an issue that some perceive as controversial or may not believe exists.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In his 17 years teaching, Ford has taught in five school districts -- rural and urban -- across Georgia and South Carolina, exposing him to a range of approaches and attitudes toward teaching 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . "I try to create the idea of us as earthlings and as part of the world," Ford said. "That is where science is struggling because they are not making a human connection."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Depending on a child's grade level, those connections can look very different.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At Friends School of Atlanta in DeKalb County, elementary science teacher Joanna Gerber focuses on getting students outside. Pre-K and kindergarten students visit the school garden to study milkweed and how it supports monarch butterflies. First and second graders mark the growth of tulip bulbs and can compare data to see if bulbs appear sooner or later than the prior year. By third and fourth grade, students begin learning about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and weather.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some units give them a path to take action. For a unit on bird study, students researched plants that were unhealthy for birds and handed out informational flyers to community members, she said. "I see a lot of young people wanting action,"Gerber said. "The challenge is to keep the momentum going."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Kim Cobb, parent of a seventh grader at Inman Middle School, was convinced the momentum was dead when last year she opened her daughter's earth science book and discovered a mere 1.5 pages on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Cobb, who also happens to be a professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech, was dismayed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 She believes textbooks can be used in conjunction with other resources but has noted some opposition to utilizing regional sources that would help give kids an understanding of how 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is directly impacting their communities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At Georgia Tech, students often arrive in Cobb's class with limited knowledge of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  issues. "They may know the broad question of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , but they don't know where the electricity is coming from that they plug their iPhone into," Cobb said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 To become 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  literate, students must have an understanding of topics such as energy systems and economics, the history of coal dependency, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  policy and solutions and community resilience, she said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia schools follow the Science Georgia Standards of Excellence, a set of performance expectations that describe what students should know after completing a course or grade, said Juan Carlos Aguilar, science program manager for the Georgia Department of Education. The standards, which are revised every four to five years depending on available funding, take a broader view of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , such as the relationship of living organisms with the environment, how 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  impacts conditions under which organisms live and how organisms react to 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Sixth graders in earth science must understand how energy from the sun impacts the Earth's weather and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , for example, while high school biology students must be able to design a solution to reduce the impact of a human activity on the environment. How teachers meet those standards is up to the teacher.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "What teachers do in their classrooms can be all over the map," said Heidi Schweingruber, director of the Board of Science Education at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. Some communities have greater challenges than others implementing curriculum and facing resistance from parents, she said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For Hannah Testa, the resistance came not from outside of school but within. When a teacher learned about Testa's environmental advocacy efforts, Testa, 16, found herself debating the existence of global warming with the educator.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At her elementary school in Forsyth County, teachers didn't spend a lot of time teaching 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , she said, but since entering West Forsyth High School, Testa, now a junior, said she has had more access to that kind of instruction and information.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 High school students in Georgia are required to complete four units of science to graduate, and courses such as environmental science, earth systems, oceanography and meteorology can offer deeper insight into 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  issues.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 During her freshman year, Testa took AP Human Geography, in which they discussed human connections to the environment, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  policy and current events, including the presidential election and Brexit. "We are talking more about real world issues and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  than I used to," said Testa.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Educators say that a school curriculum focused on observation and action can help students feel as if they are doing something about the issues while also gaining the depth of understanding needed to navigate a future that will inevitably be impacted by issues of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I am very impressed with the direction the framework and standards are pursuing, which is to have kids engage with data and learn to develop and critique evidence-based arguments," Schweingruber said. "It is an opportunity to look at what claims are being made, what they are based on and ask, 'Do I buy it?'"

\f3\fs20 \cf0 A 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  meeting in Atlanta on Thursday had all the ingredients of a political spectacle.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 With Donald Trump, a noted skeptic of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  science winning the White House, a nervous federal agency scrapped plans to host the event. Enter Al Gore. The former vice president helped revive the conference and took to the podium Thursday to talk about his signature issue.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But it was science -- not politics -- that carried the day.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and health meeting held at The Carter Center, Gore, a former Democratic presidential candidate, steered clear of mentioning Trump. Instead, he stressed that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  could render parts of the Middle East -- including some of the holiest cities on the planet -- uninhabitable. It could also cause deadly health problems and reduce life expectancy. Those in poverty will be hardest hit, he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The event was supposed to be a three-day conference held at the Centers for Disease Control. But when that event was cancelled following the presidential election, Gore helped organize a condensed, one-day meeting instead.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Gore urged scientists and health care providers to unite in efforts to combat the effects of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Among the most serious problems presented to conference attendees was the belief that the rising heat index could make parts of the world uninhabitable, Gore said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "This is a relatively new finding, that in some areas of the Middle East and north Africa, there will be, according to the scientific predictions, areas that will no longer be fit for human habitation -- beyond the limits for human survival," Gore said. "The holy cities of Mecca and Medina are in this zone. Two years in Iran, the heat index -- the combination of temperature and humidity -- reached 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "No human being can live for more than a few hours outdoors in those conditions," Gore said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Despite the gloomy outlook, Gore said there are ways to deal with the effects of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , but those will take collaboration both in the U.S. and abroad.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We do have the solutions at hand,"Gore said. "Hope is justified.We are going to win this. We have solutions that are now readily available."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Experts from Columbia University, Harvard University, the University of Wisconsin the World Health Organization and the CDC were among the speakers and panelists at the fast-paced conference.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We're doing three days in one day," Gore joked at the microphone during sessions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Atlanta resident Cindy Powell, who has worked in critical care, attended the conference because she's returning to school and is interested in public health. She was saddened the initial conference was cancelled, but said Thursday's meeting was a resilient effort.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It's better than nothing. It's a start," Powell said. "The positive forces of the world intend to move forward regardless."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Leslie Bass, a commercial photography student, didn't know exactly what she'd be attending as part of an internship. But she was shocked at the staggering numbers of health issues and deaths related to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "This is way bigger than politics, but politics in our country are going to hinder progress," Bass said. "It's not some myth. These are not alternative facts."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 The devastation wrought by Hurricane Michael brought to light a debate over environmental policy that's attracted little attention in this year's race for Georgia governor.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Whoever succeeds Gov. Nathan Deal will face consequential decisions over how to approach 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , tackle environmental regulations and decide whether to fight or embrace federal environmental standards.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That extends to questions about whether Georgia should take broader steps to prepare for more catastrophic weather, such as 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  zoning rules in low-lying areas, setting aside more money to restore vanishing shorelines and creating building code rules that anticipate rising sea levels.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Their approaches will have far-reaching consequences. With 100 miles of shoreline, Georgia's coastal counties are home to more than 500,000 people -- about 5 percent of the state's population.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Any perception that Georgia's coast is protected from devastating hurricanes because of its sheltering, concave shape and vigilant barrier islands was shattered after it was swiped by the catastrophic one-two punch of Matthew and Irma in 2016 and 2017.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And Hurricane Michael proved last week that even communities far from shore could be pummeled with devastating force, with the storm blamed for the death of an 11-year-old girl in southwest Georgia staying about 100 miles inland from where it made landfall.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 With 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists warning that warming oceans will supercharge more hurricanes, the epic storms that deliver gale-force winds and widespread flooding may become more regular occurrences.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And no matter who wins the race, he or she will face challenges in implementing policies in a state where there is no widespread agreement on the causes and effects of the planet's warming temperatures.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 'Fact-based efforts'
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Democrat Stacey Abrams tells audiences on the campaign trail that "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is real" and the state needs to begin bracing for it. She vows to strengthen environmental protections and advocate for policies that address pollution that contributes to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 She also links the warming temperatures to tantalizing economic development opportunities, saying her policies could position the state to create as many as 45,000 high-wage jobs in the growing alternative energy sector.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Republican Brian Kemp has a more cautious view of the state's role in combating 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . He supports "fact-based efforts" to protect the environment, but he doesn't believe
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "government red tape is the answer."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We can strike a balance between preserving what makes Georgia unique and being a welcoming place for businesses of all sizes and all industries to grow and prosper," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia has taken initial steps to prepare for 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , including developing long-term plans to help coastal counties adapt to rising sea levels, though experts and coastal residents say more could be done.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But the state has resisted some of the more ambitious efforts taken by other states. While Gov. Nathan Deal supported a $6 million effort in 2014 to rebuild Tybee Island's dunes, he has said it should be up to local authorities to adopt development restrictions and take other preventive measures on their own.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 'Tap the expertise'
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Kemp agrees with that stance, saying a "one-size-fits-all approach from state government is not the answer." His policy doesn't include any detailed plans to restore shoreline or take other overt preventive measures.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He's also generally opposed to new statewide regulations, such as new building codes that are the subject of heated debate in Florida. That state already has some of the nation's toughest codes, but the rules are more lenient in the Panhandle, which until recently had largely escaped direct hits.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Local communities should decide what codes and regulations address the threats they face and proceed accordingly," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Abrams, for her part, suggested she was open to broader policy 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  to prepare for the 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . She said she would "fully tap the expertise" in Georgia to develop new disaster management protocol and environmental plans for rising temperatures.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We must base our policy and planning on evidence," she said. "We have to plan for more severe storms and understand the implications for our schools, neighborhoods, businesses, roads, power grid and more."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Both, however, are united on at least one environmental front: They both support a constitutional amendment that would set aside 80 percent of existing sales taxes on sporting goods for conservation efforts that would raise $200 million over the next decade.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 President Barack Obama used his recent trip to Alaska and about every other opportunity he s gotten to proclaim that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is the most important issue of our time. We re here today to discuss the challenge that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other that s the urgent and growing threat of a 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While not all environmental scientists agree with the president, most of the mainstream media emphatically do. And they are the ones who will be grilling Republican candidates and not just the presidential candidates.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That means GOP office-seekers need to be informed about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  matters and ready with clear, evidence-backed answers. What are some of the key issues?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Is the earth warming? Well, it certainly has warmed since what was known as the Little Ice Age a cold period that lasted from about 1550 to 1850. There has been a gradual increase since about 1910, with a strong uptick between the mid-1970s and about 1997. Since then, global temperatures have been relatively flat.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But the flattening came after a significant warming trend. That means even a slight temperature increase in a given year allows the media to claim it is the warmest year on record, even if the 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is within the margin of error.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While we don t know whether the warming trend will resume in the near future, we do know that almost all the global warming proponents never saw the flattening coming. They incorrectly predicted much warmer temperatures that have not occurred.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And now some 
\f1\i\b \ul climate

\f3\fs20 \cf0 President Barack Obama used his recent trip to Alaska -- and about every other opportunity he's gotten -- to proclaim that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is the most important issue of our time. "We're here today to discuss the challenge that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other -- that's the urgent and growing threat of a 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While not all environmental scientists agree with the president, most of the mainstream media emphatically do. And they are the ones who will be grilling Republican candidates -- and not just the presidential candidates.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That means GOP office-seekers need to be informed about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  matters and ready with clear, evidence-backed answers. What are some of the key issues?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Is the earth warming? Well, it certainly has warmed since what was known as the Little Ice Age -- a cold period that lasted from about 1550 to 1850. There has been a gradual increase since about 1910, with a strong uptick between the mid-1970s and about 1997. Since then, global temperatures have been relatively flat.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But the flattening came after a significant warming trend. That means even a slight temperature increase in a given year allows the media to claim it is the warmest year on record, even if the 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is within the margin of error.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While we don't know whether the warming trend will resume in the near future, we do know that almost all the global warming proponents never saw the flattening coming. They incorrectly predicted much warmer temperatures that have not occurred.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And now some 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists are predicting a multiyear cool-down, a mini-ice age, within the next decade or so that could raise further questions about the temperature trend.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Is Arctic ice melting? While in Alaska, the president visited Exit Glacier, which has been shrinking for decades. Yes, Arctic ice has been gradually declining -- but Antarctic ice has been growing.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We know the rise-and-fall process has been going on naturally for millennia, without any help from mankind. What we don't know -- though many will say we do -- is whether the recent temperature increase is part of the natural variation that occurs about every 100,000 years or is caused by human activity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Are humans to blame? Carbon dioxide has been increasing, and most 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists believe man is playing a role in that increase. But is carbon dioxide causing the warming?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As the Environmental Protection Agency shows, for the past 400,000 years, temperature levels and carbon dioxide levels have followed virtually identical tracks.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Can the U.S. solve the problem? Journalists will ask what Republican candidates intend to do about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The U.S. is responsible for about 14.5 percent of world carbon emissions, with China at 23.5 percent. When you're only 14.5 percent of the total, you have to make huge carbon reductions just to decrease total emissions by a fraction of a percent.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The good news, at least for conservative candidates, is that the public ranks cutting carbon emissions very low among their priorities for the upcoming election.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Nearly two-thirds of Georgia voters believe the U.S. should do more to combat 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , according to a new Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll, suggesting local voters would like to see a 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  of course on an issue that's deeply divided state and federal lawmakers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The survey found that about 63% of Georgia voters think the country is not doing enough to address 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , compared with about 31% who replied the U.S. has responded adequately or even done too much.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Women were more likely than men to believe more should be done--66%compared with 58%-- and richer people making between $100,000 and $150,000 a year were almost three times more likely than the state's poorest voters to believe the country has acted appropriately.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The survey, which had a margin of error of 3 percentage points, was conducted Oct. 30 to Nov. 8 by the University of Georgia's School of Public and International Affairs. It marked the first time the AJC has asked about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in a statewide survey.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The poll was conducted the same week the Trump administration formally notified the United Nations that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  accord, the landmark 2015 pact in which nearly 200 nations agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 President Donald Trump called the accord "terrible" and "one-sided" at a recent appearance in Pittsburgh.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "What we won't do is punish the American people while enriching foreign polluters," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Overall, Georgia voters' party affiliations were a relativelyreliableindicatoroftheir opinions on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  policies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While more than 91% of Democrats surveyed said more needed to be done on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , only about 30% of their GOP peers agreed. Nearly 70%of independents, a key voting bloc in Georgia, said the U.S. response was inadequate.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 One of those Georgians is Zach Hartman, a scientific content manager in Sandy Springs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The 33-year-old said he tries not to affiliate with a political party but identified 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  as an "existential threat."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Even if it ends up not being an existential threat, we don't really get a do-over on it,"Hartman said. "I don't see the losses as great enough to justify the inaction that we're seeing and denial and outright anti-intellectualism that surrounds it."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some of the starkest divides among the poll's respondents were racial and generational. More than 84% of black voters surveyed said the country's current response was inadequate, compared with just 51%of white voters. Millennials under the age of 30 were the least likely of any age group to believe the country was doing enough to combat global warming, with roughly three-quarters of voting-age young people wanting to see more done.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 About 1 in 4 of the voters surveyed between the ages of 45 and 64 said the country was doing enough to fight 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . That included William Blake, 54, a master electrician in Leesburg.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Mother Nature is going to take care of itself, but we can control some of the emissions," he said, voicing support for technology that removes emissions from coal plant exhaust.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But Blake also warned about carbon-cutting "overkill," and he voiced support for Trump's move to remove the U.S. from the Paris agreement.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Look at all the other countries -- they're just polluting everything," he said after acknowledging that the U.S. is a leading carbon emitter. "If anything, we need to push for other countries to get up to our standards."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Over the past three years, Trump has moved to undo many of the major actions undertaken by his predecessor to reduce global warming-causing greenhouse gas emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He opted to replace President Barack Obama's strict power plant regulations last year with a looser alternative that gave states such as Georgia broad leeway to set their own targets for cutting emissions from coal stations. And in September, Trump blocked state-level efforts in California to regulate emissions from auto tailpipes, another major contributor to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Democrats have not lined up behind a single counterproposal.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Beyond a symbolic vote in the U.S. House urging Trump to keep the country in the Paris agreement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not brought any 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  legislation to the floor. Shortly after Democrats retook the majority in the chamber, she created a Select Committee on the 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Crisis that plans to issue recommendations next year.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Freshman U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's sweeping "Green New Deal," which calls for the country to mobilize to end its dependency on fossil fuels over the next decade, has inspired several White House hopefuls but has not received a hearing on Capitol Hill. It has also provided an opening for the GOP to attack vulnerable Democrats on the campaign trail.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Locally, Georgia has taken some initial steps to combat 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  such as developing long-term plans to help coastal counties adapt to rising sea levels. But officials have resisted the more ambitious efforts undertaken by other states.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Gov. Brian Kemp took a cautious view of the issue during last year's election campaign. He said then that he supports "fact-based efforts" to protect the environment without involving more "government red tape," and earlier this year he said "we've got to be prepared" for extreme weather.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At the same time, Kemp has said "government cannot do everything for everybody."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "People are going to have to be responsible," he said, "especially when they're property owners."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Former President Barack Obama called 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  an "existential issue" and emphasized the importance of equity in solving sustainability and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  problems during a Wednesday morning appearance at a green building conference in Atlanta.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Thousands of people packed the Georgia World Congress Center to hear Obama at the annual Greenbuild International Conference and Expo.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 His appearance coincided with the Democratic presidential debate taking place in Atlanta on Wednesday night. 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  has become one of the major issues along the campaign trail for the 2020 Election. Ten of the candidates participated in a Sept. 4 CNN-sponsored town hall about the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  crisis, and the topic has come up often during debates.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Obama steered clear of political talk during his hourlong conversation with Mahesh Ramanujam, president and CEO of the U.S. Green Building Council, focusing instead on a range of issues from social equity to training the next generation of leaders. He spoke about the urgency of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and referenced his work in finalizing the Paris Accord -- the voluntary, nonbinding pledge from almost 200 parties to reduce their carbon emissions over time -- from which the Trump administration announced it would formally withdraw earlier this month.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The former president also urged the audience to think about equity in solving issues of sustainability--connecting global economic inequality with 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . "The reason I say those two things are connected is that it is hard to figure out how we solve sustainability issues and deal with 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  if you also have huge gaps in wealth and opportunity and education ... as wealth gets more and more concentrated and more and more energy is used up by the few, the many become resentful and it undermines our sense of politics and a sense of community. It is hard for us then to mobilize the body politic around taking collective action," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Growing up in Hawaii gave him a certain mindfulness about limited resources and land, which even as a child he could appreciate and recognize the need to preserve, he said. Those are values he instilled in his own children, who have a developed a 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  consciousness typical of their generation. Sasha, for example, once banned the family from using plastic bottles, he said. To help move the next generation into effective leadership, Obama said programming from the Obama Foundation centers on training young people to use strategies and tactics that result in action.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In the fight against 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , it is important, he said, to be sure our values and actions are in alignment. "If we say our children or the next generation are the most important thing, then we have to act in accordance with those values," he said. "Any society where how we live strays too far from what we say we believe is going to have problems, and currently there is more divergence than I would like."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While everyone can do their part individually to address 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  concerns, there are some issues that must be dealt with collectively, Obama said.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 WASHINGTON --- Georgia Tech 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  researcher Judith Curry does not deny that humans contribute to global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But the professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences has won praise from Republicans on Capitol Hill by questioning the prevailing verdict that humans are the primary cause of rising temperatures and doubting the need for drastic, economy-shifting action by policy-makers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Now one key Democrat is investigating whether Curry's voice is being funded by interests that profit from the energy status quo, a notion Curry flatly rejects and suggests "intimidation and harassment" as a motivation for the inquiry.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., sent letters to the employers of Curry and six other 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  researchers who have testified on Capitol Hill, asking for their funding sources and other information.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Grijalva, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, cited a New York Times story about a Harvard-Smithsonian researcher who did not disclose grants from utilities such as Atlanta's Southern Co.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "They've all testified before Congress, and they've all been against the consensus about the warming of the planet," Grijalva told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of the seven researchers he is investigating.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Especially on Natural Resources, issues like 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , you have to value the integrity of the science," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Curry told the AJC that all her funding comes from government sources.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In a lengthy response on her blog, Curry pointed out that every time she testifies before Congress she includes information about her funding sources in written testimony, and she has never been asked about it before.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I think that biases in testimony related to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  are more likely to be ideological and political than related to funding," Curry wrote.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "So what is the point of asking for detailed financial information (including travel) from these academic researchers?" she asked. "Intimidation and harassment is certainly one reason that comes to mind."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, a Monroe Republican who also serves on the House Natural Resources Committee, questioned whether the inquiry was a valuable use of the committee's time and energy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It is a shame that because a scientist has reached a different conclusion on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  science than the liberal elite that the integrity of her research would be called into question," Hice said in a prepared statement.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Curry has never testified before the Natural Resources Committee, but she has appeared multiple times on Capitol Hill.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last year, she told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee: "Anthropogenic greenhouse warming (originating with human activity) is a theory whose basic mechanism is well understood, but whose magnitude is highly uncertain. Multiple lines of evidence presented in the recent (Intergovernmental Panel on 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ) fifth assessment report suggest that the case for anthropogenic warming is now weaker than in 2007, when the fourth assessment report was published."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Also on the panel that day before the Democratic-controlled committee was Andrew Dessler of Texas A&M University.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We know the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is warming," Dessler testified. "We know that humans are now in the driver's seat of the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  system. We know that, over the next century, if nothing is done to rein in emissions, temperatures will likely increase enough to profoundly 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  the planet. I wish this weren't true, but it is what the science tells us."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The story of Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics researcher Wei-Hock Soon prompted Grijalva's inquiry. The New York Times found that Soon accepted $1.2 million from the fossil fuel industry in the past 10 years and often did not disclose the funding.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Soon has said that global warming can be explained by variations in the sun's energy. The Times, via documents unearthed by the environmental group Greenpeace, found that $409,000 of Soon's funding came from Southern Company Services, a subsidiary of the Atlanta-based utility giant. Southern has been one of the most aggressive and active forces in Washington opposing the Obama administration's regulations on carbon emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In his letter to Georgia Tech President G.P. Peterson, Grijalva wrote: "My colleagues and I cannot perform our duties if research and testimony provided to us is influenced by undisclosed financial relationships."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Among other requests, Grijalva asked for Georgia Tech's policy on financial disclosure, Curry's disclosure forms, Curry's government testimony, any correspondence related to preparing her testimony, a detailed description of Curry's external funding and her pay since 2007.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 After Hurricane Irma finished its assault on coastal Georgia last year, Jeff Adams went to survey the damage on St. Marys waterfront, a popular tourist pit stop on the way to Cumberland Island. He saw streets flooded and littered with Styrofoam from the bottoms of destroyed docks. The few boats that hadn't sunk were battered. The smell of diesel fuel, leaking from the cracked vessels, hung the air.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Residents were stunned. Adams? He was versed in research on the vulnerabilities of the Georgia's 100-mile-long coastline. And he was thankful. "I was amazed it didn't get us worse," recalled Adams, who was then the city's community development director.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A year later, Adams is among numerous officials who weren't surprised to read dire warnings for Georgia -- and the entire Southeast --
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 in the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  report issued last week by 13 federal agencies. The sprawling and detailed document predicts that in the coming decades the coast will be at greater risk of flooding amid rising sea levels and stronger, more frequent hurricanes. It suggests potentially heightened danger of wildfires in the state's northern mountains. It urges communities to steel themselves for myriad issues from increased heat in every corner of Georgia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The message is clear: 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is already hurting the state -- and it will only get worse.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The topic, of course, remains fraught politically. President Donald Trump, long a skeptic of the causes underpinning 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and the scope of its damage, disavowed the report, even though it came from his own administration.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But the science is becoming more accepted. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans and a majority of all Americans now acknowledge 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , according to a new poll from Monmouth University. A deeper divide in opinion remains over whether the cause is man-made.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Regardless, officials and researchers in Georgia have been studying the issue, albeit at times quietly, and taking steps to prepare.They're often using taxpayer money to do it. That's been especially true in the past three years, which have been marked by a series of punishing hurricanes and large wildfires in both north and South Georgia. Those events left billions of dollars of damage in their wake and, in the case of the storms, killed seven people.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Researchers with the Georgia 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Project--founded by the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech and Emory University -- are creating a massive public database with their findings in hopes that officials will use the information to drive policy 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 With work already underway in Georgia, some said the new federal report serves to raise tensions and remind that more must be done, quickly, by all levels of government.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I feel like we're doing all we can," said Jason Buelterman, mayor of Tybee Island, which some projections suggest could be largely underwater in 80 years. "There's nothing we can do unless Washington and the world addresses the issue."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Coast at highest risk The most clearly articulated danger for Georgia in the report -- written by researchers with federal departments of agriculture, commerce and others, including NASA -- is to historic communities along the coast.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 High-tide flooding has increased since the 1960s in coastal cities in the Southeast, with record years now routine. In Savannah, 2016 saw a record 38 days of flooding problems. Back in 1960, buoys at nearby Fort Pulaski recorded only a few days a year of high-tide flooding. "Without significant adaptation measures," the researchers wrote, "these regions are projected to experience daily high-tide flooding by the end of the century."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This, along with more powerful storms, jeopardizes homes, infrastructure and Savannah's largely tourism-based economy. And, of course, the report only lists Savannah as an example. Other cities on the coastline face the same concerns.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The report also predicts the Southeast could see more wildfires, citing the drought of 2016,which contributed to the most destructive blazes the southern Appalachian Mountains have seen in a century. Those fires burned tens of thousands of acres across the Chattahoochee National Forest.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The western U.S. sees the most wildfires, the document notes, but the Southeast has the largest area of so-called prescribed burns, blazes set intentionally to keep the forests healthy. "In the future, rising temperatures and increases in the duration and intensity of drought are expected to increase wildfire occurrence and also reduce the effectiveness of prescribed fire," the researchers wrote.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Forests across the state could face the same risks as northern Georgia, depending on how droughts and projected increases in rain shake out. Other estimates, such as from the International Journal of Wildland Fire, suggest southeast Georgia could see greater threats than north Georgia from wildfire by 2070, according to data in a recent New York Times report. The Okefenokee Swamp has already been scarred by large, destructive fires in recent years.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Local areas act first
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The state of Georgia has taken initial steps to prepare for 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , including developing long-term plans to help coastal communities adapt, but much of the action so far is at the local level, where the danger is harder to ignore.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "From the city's perspective," Nick Deffley, Savannah's sustainability director, said, "we know it is an issue that's only going to be increasing."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At the moment, Savannah is working with Chatham County to install a series of sea-level censors around the city and on barrier islands. The goal of the project, funded by a grant from Georgia Tech, is to help the county with storm response in real time. Deffley said they'll be monitoring canals, and upgrades are regularly being made to the stormwater infrastructure.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In St.Marys, City Manager John Holman said, in the last year and a half alone, the city has invested $2.1 million in studies and infrastructure improvements.Workers are putting in retention ponds, permeable paving material in parking areas and six gates to keep tide from overwhelming the stormwater system.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We've taken to heart the recommendations,"Holman said. "We're looking out at least 50 to 100 years."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Up on Tybee, recent years have seen state-funded projects to build up dunes in hopes of combating storm surge. In 2019, the Georgia Department of Transportation is planning to raise parts of the causeway leading to the island. The road regularly gets flooded and must be shut down, leaving residents marooned. But the mayor pointed out the improvements will only protect from day-to-day tide problems; the highway is expected to still get overwhelmed during hurricanes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He said the community has also applied for federal funding to lift 65 houses. The grant would cover 85 percent of the costs; homeowners would handle the rest.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Like hurricanes of the past three years did for the coast, the 2016 wildfires served as sobering reminders farther north. "It really brought into focus that we need to do more, that it's more urgent," said Steven Bekkerus, a Georgia-based spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 To combat the dangers, the service works with state and local partners on myriad programs and initiatives to raise awareness about the ease with which a huge fire can be started. It also does regular controlled burns, such as one in April at Tallulah Gorge State Park, and works to keep "hazardous fuel," such as fallen leaves and wood debris, off the floor of the forests.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Attitude shift
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Time and again, experts and officials said the greatest challenges is 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  the way Georgians -- and Americans -- respond to environmental peril. Up to now, the idea has been your community gets damaged, then you clean up and prepare for the next hit.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We need to do something, and we've got to do it now," said Adams, the former community development director in St. Marys, who now works in Oregon. He said he enjoyed working in St. Marys because, even before Hurricane Irma tore up downtown, people in the city and Camden County governments understood and accepted the dangers they faced.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But local governments only have so much money to spend on this. They need more consistent federal funding and support from the state, Adams said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It's yet to be seen what approach Gov.-elect Brian Kemp's administration will take. His office said it hasn't yet reviewed the new federal report.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 On the campaign trail, he largely agreed with fellow Republican Gov. Nathan Deal's belief that it should be up to local authorities to adopt development restrictions and take other preventive measures. Kemp said: a "one-size-fits-all approach from state government is not the answer." His policy rolled out in the campaign didn't include any detailed plans to restore shoreline or take other direct preventive measures.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Patricia Yager, a UGA professor involved in the Georgia 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Project, said the organization's target audience isn't top government leaders -- it's municipal and county governments who don't need approval from on high to get to work.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "A lot of people are moving forward on this issue regardless of what's happening at the highest level," she said. "You're seeing even very conservative towns in South Georgia respond."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Just this week, she was excited about how people across the state are responding. The Georgia 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Project welcomed several new academic partners: Agnes Scott College, Georgia Southern University, Spelman College and the University of North Georgia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As a professor, she's even seen a shift in students' attitudes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 About 10 years ago, students were becoming less incredulous about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , but they were still asking how it would affect them personally. Now, few question the science, and the question they ask most frequently is:How can we fix it?

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Slowly, carefully, Republicans in Georgia are shifting on the topic of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , taking care not to offend the fellow in the White House -- the one who has claimed it's a Chinese hoax.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, a Republican whose congressional district encompasses the 100-mile Georgia coast, is only one of those in transition.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last month, Carter was appointed to a select congressional committee on global warming -- and in the process, confessed that "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is real and the need to protect our environment is real." The problem, he said, is how to address the situation without killing the U.S. economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last week, Carter again made news. The Savannah-area congressman maintains that he remains a "drill, baby, drill" Republican, but he penned a letter to the acting secretary of the interior, asking that his state be excluded from Trump administration plans to allow for the exploration of oil off the Atlantic coast.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Carter explained that he had undergone no 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in philosophy. He had not succumbed to any desire to wean the Earth away from fossil fuels. Rather, Carter pointed to a resolution passed by the state House in Atlanta one day earlier, opposing offshore drilling.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The federal government should respect the people of Georgia to make this critical decision for themselves," Carter wrote.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 House Resolution 48 was a strange creature on several counts. Its objections to offshore drilling made no mention of rising sea levels or increased carbon dioxide levels, but focused on the hazards that oil spills and leaks would pose to a fishing and tourism industry that generates 21,000 jobs along the shore.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Migrating right whales and non-migrating nuclear submarines docking at King's Bay would be endangered, the resolution said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Another sign that Republicans are still a work in progress when it comes to environmental matters: The first signer of the resolution was state Rep. Carl Gillard, a Democrat from Garden City.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The other five sponsors listed were Republican, none of whom could be characterized as 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  revolutionaries. One of the GOP signers on HR 48 was state Rep. Don Hogan of St. Simon's Island -- who had also authored a separate bill to loosen restrictions on beachside development.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Hogan was asked in a Senate committee whether this was wise, given rising sea levels. "There's a lot of controversy about the sea level rising," Hogan replied. "That's a controversy within itself. But I've not noticed it in 52 years living by it."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 None of HR 48's authors were willing to be seen with their legislation when it came before the House Natural Resources Committee on March 21. It passed anyway.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But after the committee vote, Chairman Lynn Smith, R-Newnan, had this to say: "Will all of you please tell the signers of this bill that they owe us -- big time."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The resolution to oppose oil exploration off the Georgia coast passed the entire House on the last day of the 2019 session, on a 125-36 vote. Every "no" vote was cast by a Republican. Nineteen lawmakers were excused from voting, or simply did not vote. Most of those were Republican, too. In other words, the House Republican caucus was split neatly in half by the issue.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But if the Republican Party is to avoid a drubbing in 2020, nationally and in Georgia, it must find topics that can attract independents and resonate with white, college-educated women who are disillusioned with Trump.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Regardless of the president's position, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  might be one of those issues. And so we have an organization calling itself Conservatives for Clean Energy, a loose collection of political consultants in 20 states. GOP consultant Steve Butler is one of those involved in the Georgia operation, anticipated to crank up later this month.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The group's objective is to provide 2020 Republicans with the language needed to talk about energy alternatives to fossil fuels -- solar especially, but also wind, biomass and nuclear. "We're not liberals, we don't believe in subsidies -- we actually believe in free market solutions, Butler said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The one requirement necessary for a Republican to survive a conversation on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is the ability to utter the same words that Buddy Carter used: "
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is real."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In fact, Butler said, the group -- he wouldn't talk about what parties might be bankrolling it -- has its origins in last November's release of a federal scientific report on global warming that said the phenomenon was real, human-induced and potentially catastrophic.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I don't believe it," Trump said in response.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Conservatives for Clean Energy already has some Georgia polling in hand to help GOP candidates test messages. The survey, completed in March, indicated that support for nuclear power is on the bubble, with Republicans and independents favoring the construction of two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle, and Democrats torn.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Older white men drive support for Plant Vogtle's expansion, while younger white women are among its most concentrated opponents.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Solar energy appears to be the big winner. More than 90 percent said it was important to protect the right of property owners to lease their land for renewable energy production -- which in Georgia means solar farms. Georgia has already made progress on that front, via the state Public Service Commission -- which could give Republicans an immediate bragging point.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Butler said he's already made appointments to discuss environmental messaging with Carter, U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson, R-West Point, and Karen Handel, who is out to retake the Sixth District congressional seat in north metro Atlanta.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 State Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black is on board, too, Butler said. The devastation caused by a Hurricane Michael that charged out of an overheated Gulf of Mexico may be a factor.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "You've got to think 20 or 30 years down the line if you're in farming," Butler said. "Agriculture people -- they're the easiest to turn around on this issue."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 One of the U.S. Congress' first House subcommittee hearings on the greenhouse effect and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  was held almost 40 years ago, on July 31, 1981. In the book "Losing Earth,"New
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Orleans-based author Nathaniel Rich discusses how such hearings tend to be stage-managed for maximum impact on the press and public, and how environmental and health issues tend to come equipped with heroes, victims and villains.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rich quotes Tom Grumbly, staff director for then young congressman Al Gore, as being skeptical about the political value of holding a hearing for the greenhouse effect. "There are no villains," Grumbly says. "Besides, who's your victim?"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Gore answers, "If we don't do something, we're all going to be the victims."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Reflecting on the subsequent decades of relative inaction, Rich pulls no punches in identifying villains and the long-term consequences of the victims, who tend to be all the inhabitants of a warming planet.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Subtitled "A Recent History," "Losing Earth" dramatizes the increasingly dire findings in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  research and the activism to minimize the effects of carbon emissions and global warming. Rich takes a unique perspective on the events by focusing on the science and politics of the issue from 1979 through 1989, arguing that we knew everything important then that we know now, but we squandered our first and best opportunities to address the problem.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Losing Earth" originated as a 30,000-word magazine article that took up a full issue of The New York Times Magazine. Rich, the magazine's writer-at-large, has expanded the article into a 200-page book that reads partly like an accessible history of recent events and partly like an impassioned polemic.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It isn't meant to comfort the reader, and Rich's introduction lays out the stakes: a rise in average global temperature of more than two degrees Celsius (which currently seems inevitable) promises devastating consequences, such as starvation, drought, abandonment of coastal cities and increasingly violent conflicts over decreasingly available resources.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The book's two primary protagonists come across less as "heroes" than simply well-informed but ordinarypeoplemotivatedtospeakout. Rafe Pomerance is a tall, tweedy, emotionally demonstrative activist and lobbyist involved with groups such as Friends of the Earth. James Hansen is a calm, cool NASA atmospheric physicist who becomes one of the first and most outspoken researchers on the issue. But they're just two in a large cast of characters involved with an issue that drew bipartisan concern, at least in its early years, from the likes of EPA administrator and establishment Republican William Reilly.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Much of the book follows the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  issue over the decade as it wends its way through a maze of scientific, corporate and governmental organizations. If you're not a policy wonk, it can require close reading to keep track of all the conferences, committees and institutes, and whether they have agendas beyond pure research.A glossarywouldhavecomeinhandy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Fortunately, Rich has a novelist's instinct for finding quirky, memorable details. One scientific conference takes place in a coastal hotel nicknamed "The Pink Palace," which becomes a
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 candy-colored backdrop as scientists try and
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 fail to craft a strongly worded joint statement. "Losing Earth" offers brief tangents about such groups as The Jasons, a longstanding independent group of elite scientific advisers to the U.S. government.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At one point Pomerance and other activists watch jealously as the threat to the ozone layer in the mid-1980s steals the thunder from 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone : although a scientific misnomer, the "ozone hole" proved far more effective at inspiring chlorofluorocarbon(CFC) reduction than 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  activism did in controlling carbon dioxide.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In the last quarter of the book, a colorful antagonist emerges in the person of John Sununu, the famously combative Chief of Staff of the Bush Administration, who effectively becomes the face of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  denialism of the time. Rich examines whether Sununu single-handedly torpedoed the 1989 Noordwijk conference's attempt to establish a binding global treaty to limit greenhouse gases.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The author steps back to suggest the real villain may not be any one person, but a collective institutional resistance to accept short-term costs in favor of longterm benefits. Repeatedly the book shows politicians, oil industry executives and other influential figures voicing abstract concerns over 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , only to walk back their statements the closer they get to actually doing something.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The book's narrative is generally so strong that it leaves you wishing Rich brought similar research to bear on the subsequent decades, as the science grew more explicit, but 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  denialism dug in even harder. It's like the failed Noordwijk conference marks the end of the first act, but Act Two is confined to a 27-page afterword.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rich's righteous rhetoric, supported by a command of the facts, has a sharpness comparable to Thomas Paine's pamphlets arguing the case for U.S. independence from England. His afterword in particular pulls no punches: "When a government relaxes regulations on coal-fired plants or erases scientific data from a federal website, it is guilty of more than merely bowing to corporate interests; it commits crimes against humanity."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Losing Earth is not a book to be read at bedtime, assuming you don't want to be stressed out over the globe's fate while trying to sleep. Rich clearly wants to wake readers up.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 A winemaker walks into a barbershop and sits in the barber's chair. The barber notices the winemaker looks sad and asks, "Andre, why are you looking so glum?"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Andre replies, "Due to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , the temperatures are rising in Burgundy, France. That's created an unprecedented streak of great vintages, about a decade's worth, in fact."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "That's good," says the barber.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "No, that's bad. The popularity of Burgundy has swelled worldwide demand to such an extent that prices for many these wines have skyrocketed beyond what most wine lovers can afford."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "That's bad."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "No, that's good. Burgundy does make very special wines from chardonnay and pinot noir grapes, but there are dozens of other regions around the world that also make great wines from chardonnay and pinot noir. I've recently explored the Willamette Valley in Oregon and discovered a burgeoning trend of high-quality chardonnay wines to go along with their thriving pinot noir industry. Places like Patagonia in Argentina and South Island in New Zealand are great place for folks priced out of Burgundy wines to look for delicious chardonnays and pinot noirs."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Oh, that's good."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "No, that's bad. 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is creating these opportunities for some wine regions at the expense of others. Here, let me read you a little bit from an article that my friend, Joel Kostka, sent me from the May 7 edition of EOS, the earth and space science journal of the American Geophysical Union. Dr. Kostka is a 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  researcher and microbiologist down at Georgia Tech. I just happen to have the article right here.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It says: Past research has shown that under a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions scenario, places like Australia, Italy, Spain, France and South Africa would see a sharp decrease in grape-growing productivity --- anywhere from 25 percent to 73 percent, depending on the region. Some wineries are already moving their production toward the poles, where the heat can be less unrelenting. Warmer weather may also affect the taste and alcohol content of wine because temperature-induced chemical processes that occur within growing grapes could make them less desirable to consumers."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Oh my, that's bad."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "No, that's good. In the very same article, JoAnna Wendel, reporting on the 2015 Joint Assembly of U.S. and Canadian geoscientist organizations in Montreal, Quebec, writes:
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Bottom line: 'In terms of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  conditions, we can expect increased wine-making potential' in the southern regions of Quebec, Roy said at the press conference. These regions may be able to grow more varieties of grapes, such as merlot, pinot noir and chardonnay, which could make these future wineries' products more desirable to consumers." Wendel quoted Philippe Roy, lead researcher and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scenarios specialist at the Ouranos Consortium on Regional Climatology and Adaptation to 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Hey, that's good."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "No, that's bad. It's just another straw on the camel's back of evidence that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is real with very real consequences. In his study, that Roy fellow pointed out the unpredictable nature of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  could include more vine-destroying hail storms and increased humidity levels that can cause disease to flourish in the vineyards. Only a few outcomes, like more and better wines from Canada, are good."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "That's bad."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Yes. That's bad."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 At the 35,000-foot level, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  remains a matter of loud dispute among Republicans.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In the undercard portion of last Wednesday's CNBC presidential debate, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham pushed the GOP envelope and acknowledged that "we're heating up the planet." Likewise, former New York Gov. George Pataki declared it "not appropriate" to think that human activity isn't at least partially to blame.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But those are outlying opinions, offset by hardcore skepticism expressed by Republicans closer to the front of the pack.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Donald Trump, for instance, has called 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, who are out to sabotage the U.S. industrial base. In an interview with conservative firebrand Glenn Beck, recorded just before last week's debate, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  wasn't science, but a Sierra Club-generated religion.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Such is the high-altitude situation among Republicans. At sea level, however, the view is much different. Take, for instance, Jason Buelterman, mayor of Tybee Island on the Georgia coast.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last Sunday, Buelterman had returned from a trip to New Hampshire, where he participated in Rising Tides 2015, a conference on the coastal impact of rising sea levels in the United States, aimed at local government officials. It was a nonpartisan event, but Republican attendees --- count Buelterman among them --- outnumbered Democratic ones.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Forty-eight hours after the mayor returned, Tybee Island made a little history. On Tuesday morning, a 10.47-foot high tide swamped much of the island and U.S. 80, the only road that links 3,000 residents to Savannah and the mainland.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It was the third-highest tide on record. But that doesn't really tell the story. Those higher tides in 1940 and 1947 were produced by surges from hurricanes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 No such storms struck the Georgia coast last week. We would have noticed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The king tides on Tuesday and Wednesday were the product of the moon making a closer-than-usual pass, a stiff wind and rising sea levels.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That last condition is the result of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Heated water expands and ice caps melt. Volume increases.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It's unfortunate that we had this incident with the tide, but I think what it has done is gotten people's attention all over this state," Buelterman said. "I can't think of another island anywhere that is completely cut off from the mainland for hours at a time."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 What happened on the Georgia coast last week was predicted last year by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report, which said that "clear evidence" of rising sea levels would increase flooding throughout the coastal United States.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A U.S. 80 that is covered with water three or five times a year now might see that happen 35 to 40 times a year by 2050. Much of it would be "nuisance" flooding, the report said. Which might have applied to Tybee Island last week, except that it didn't.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We had to have a helicopter on standby, we had the Coast Guard on alert in case we had a heart attack. The school's shut down," Mayor Buelterman said in a phone interview on Thursday. That's slightly more than a nuisance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 During his 10 years as mayor, Buelterman said he's been pushing for a rebuilt and raised U.S. 80 --- "doing everything short of a hunger strike." But his argument has been based largely on the vulnerability of the mostly two-lane road, and thus his tourist-heavy island, to traffic accidents. A rising sea is now another argument in his favor. Maybe a strong one.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "All this money gets spent to get people to work 10 minutes faster. We have an island that's inaccessible. This is a safety issue. That should be the priority," Buelterman said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Tybee Island is addressing other issues as well. "I got a fairly dysfunctional city council to vote unanimously to plan and budget for 14 to 20 inches of sea level rise by 2060," said Councilman Paul Wolff. "That was in 2010."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 An inventory of at-risk infrastructure followed. The road to the mainland was named a top priority. Another: three freshwater wells. The wells themselves are sealed, which protects them from saltwater swamping. But the electronic controls need to be raised.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This kind of work is occurring up and down the Georgia coast, often courtesy of federal grants, often with the help of University of Georgia researchers and the state Department of Natural Resources.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The state of Georgia has scientific data that demonstrates the need to plan for an increase in sea level rise at a rate of one meter for the next 100 years. This data comes from NOAA's tide gauge at Fort Pulaski, Ga.," said DNR spokeswoman Mary Kathryn Yearta, in an email.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This is the same state Department of Natural Resources that, earlier this year, reported that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  --- and the study did use that term --- could put Georgia wildlife on the move over the next three or four decades. In some cases, the destination will be extinction. Think songbirds.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The point is that, yes, you may have GOP presidential candidates who prefer to dispute volumes of data about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Possibly, they are obliged to constituencies on higher ground.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 You may even have governors and state lawmakers, in Georgia and elsewhere, who prefer to duck cause-and-effect by declaring themselves non-scientists. When you acknowledge a problem exists, you tacitly admit an obligation to fix it. And that could be expensive.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But you do have a class of people on the Georgia coast who see things with their own eyes and their own gauges. They are mayors, council members, county commissioners, scientists and even government bureaucrats. Republicans as well as Democrats.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Moreover, an official arm of state government says now it possesses evidence that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is real.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The sea is rising, and not everyone can wait for Donald Trump and Ted Cruz to 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  their minds.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 PARIS --- Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, in Paris this week with thousands of other leaders concerned about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , says cities can play a significant role in addressing global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Atlanta already has enacted significant sustainability measures, he notes, including requiring large-scale commercial property owners to track energy and water usage; pledging to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020; adding electric vehicles to its city fleet; and pursuing a solar energy program for municipal buildings.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While Reed isn't part of negotiations held at the official United Nations summit, he traveled to France to participate in gatherings of mayors and regional leaders being held in tandem with the international talks.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Friday's 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Summit for Local Leaders, led by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and U.N. Special Envoy for Cities and 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Michael Bloomberg, highlighted what city leaders can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The message is especially meaningful in states like Georgia, which still lacks agreement by top officials on the nature and threat of global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We're taking on the issue of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  action right now, and we're trying to act in a decisive manner," said Reed, in between sessions at Paris City Hall.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But asked what state leaders should do on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  issues, Reed --- known for his positive relationship with Republican Gov. Nathan Deal and members of the Legislature --- was circumspect.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I think we have the leadership in place if they want to act, but I'm not really focused on what other people are doing," Reed said. "As long as the state structure isn't an impediment to municipal action, I think we can accomplish quite a lot."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Friday's local leaders summit, one of several events that Reed is attending while here, attracted nearly 400 mayors from across the world, according to its organizers. Many, like Reed, have signed the "Compact of Mayors," an agreement to enact policy 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and track the results.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 French President Francois Hollande spoke at the event, thanking local officials for coming despite the Nov. 13 terror attacks in his country. Several Democratic U.S. senators came to rally behind President Barack Obama's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  agenda, which is facing opposition from Senate Republicans.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Also speaking were technology bigwigs, political heavyweights and Hollywood celebrities, including Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Redford. That's to say nothing of the countless 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists and environmental leaders in the crowd.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "This is the Disney World for 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  geeks," said Stephanie Stuckey Benfield, a former state legislator who now serves as Reed's sustainability director.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Benfield was in her element as she swapped business cards with politicians and environmental movers and shakers from around the globe, a networking of grand order against the backdrop of Paris City Hall's Versailles-like architecture.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 She said she hoped to score 30 seconds with Bloomberg --- former New York mayor --- while here to ask him to fund a project manager position for Atlanta's new solar energy program. As of Friday, she had been unsuccessful in cornering the magnate. She came close earlier, only to have Bloomberg whisked away.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I had my pitch ready and a mayor from Jordan totally intercepted," she lamented.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Benfield said she hopes the summit will lead to even greater discussions with like minds about ways cities can work together on environmental issues.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 She also noted that Georgia, despite its lack of accord on the source of global warming, has taken some significant steps. Earlier this year, the state Legislature passed House Bill 57, the Solar Power Free Market Financing Act, which makes it more affordable for Georgia homeowners and small businesses to put solar panels on their rooftops.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "You don't have to embrace 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  to make progress," she said.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms will testify in front of a U.S. Senate committee today about Atlanta's efforts to combat 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Bottoms is one of five mayors of major U.S. cities who will testify in front of the Senate Democrats' Special Committee on the 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Crisis. She will be the only mayor of a Southern city and the only female mayor to offer testimony at the committee's inaugural hearing. Mayor Kirk Cardwell of Honolulu, Hawaii; Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul, Minnesota; Mayor William Peduto of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Mayor Ted Wheeler of Portland, Oregon will also testify.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The hearing is intended to discuss what large cities are doing to "cut carbon pollution and become more resilient to the impacts of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," according to a press release from the committee. The mayors will also discuss how the federal government can help cities in these efforts.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In Bottoms' prepared testimony, she cites Clean Energy Atlanta, the city's "mitigation strategy and action-oriented plan," as a chief part of the city's work to combat 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Clean Energy Atlanta, adopted by the Atlanta City Council in March, includes a commitment to transition municipal operations to 100 percent clean energy usage by 2035. The plan also includes efforts to help residents transition to clean energy use.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We feel that this ambitious goal is critical to help reduce the worst impacts of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," Bottoms' prepared testimony says. "We are taking concrete steps as part of this plan to ensure that every Atlantan, no matter their zip code, is protected from the adverse effects of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The hearing will begin at 1 p.m. today at the U.S. Capitol. It was not listed Tuesday on the broadcast schedule for C-SPAN, the network that broadcasts congressional proceedings, but may be streamed on c-span.org.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 For 82 years, a tidal gauge has been located at the same spot on the Georgia coast, at the Fort Pulaski National Monument on Cockspur Island.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 On Tuesday, it became clear that Hurricane Matthew's record sea surge of last October would not be surpassed. Hurricane Irma's shoreward push fell short by a mere 3 inches and 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 You might think this good news, until you realize that Matthew was corralled in the Atlantic. Irma clawed her way up the west coast of Florida, and still had energy to maul the East Coast -- inundating Jacksonville, covering much of Tybee Island, and flooding the streets of Savannah and Charleston.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In other words, the second-place finisher at Fort Pulaski did all that with one hand tied behind her back. Never mind her ability, at the same time, to cover the entire state of Georgia with a green radar mitten.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 You no doubt have heard that Scott Pruitt, the head of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, thinks it "insensitive" to discuss 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  policy in this particular 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , which has given us both Harvey and Irma over a three-week period.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Yes, we need to be respectful of a grim body count that stretches 2,000 miles, from the Caribbean to well beyond Houston. Lost homes and other property will take years to recoup as well.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But I will take my permission from Tom\'e1s Regalado, the mayor of suffering Miami. Of course, we should talk about it, he said: "This is a truly, truly poster child for what is to come."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Harvey and Irma were killer storms, no doubt. But they were policy drivers, too. Beyond the death and destruction, the past four weeks have amounted to a nonstop, TV-driven campaign against federal cuts to this country's meteorological operations -- as proposed by President Donald Trump this spring.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Aside from cuts to scientific research elsewhere, Trump proposed to end a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration program to build better prediction models for tornadoes in the South, and $11 million from a tsunami-warning program for the West Coast.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The National Weather Service would receive a 5 percent haircut. But NOAA's weather-satellite budget would be trimmed by 17 percent. Scientists presume the Trump administration has attempted to target 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  research rather than weather forecasting. But the two bleed into each other.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "So yes, they're not cutting the actual weather service, but one of the primary tools that the weather service uses -- that office is going to get cut massively," said Scott Weaver, leader of the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  science team at the D.C.-based Environmental Defense Fund.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Both Harvey and Irma demonstrated that more intense storms require closer watching. "As we're starting to experience more extreme events, the ability to predict the weather in real time becomes even more important than it was just 20 or 30 years ago," Weaver said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In Athens, Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric science program at the University of Georgia and a former president of the American Meteorological Society, characterized the tracking of Harvey and Irma as an effective demonstration of science that works.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The first National Hurricane Center bulletin on Harvey was issued at 11 a.m. on Aug. 17. It made landfall in Texas eight days later. Irma was first noticed on Aug. 30, and struck the Keys nine days later.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "With both Harvey and Irma, we were talking about the threat of these days to weeks in advance. That's not by accident. That's because of advances that we're making," Shepherd said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He thinks Trump's cuts are being reconsidered. "My sense is that cuts won't be as dramatic as originally proposed by the administration," Shepherd said. "Congress is learning the value of NOAA."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It's possible that Harvey and Irma may even make it easier for Republicans to utter the words "
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone " and "
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ." Together.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Daniel Rochberg is a former U.S. State Department worker on the faculty of Emory University. He's one of the organizers behind the Georgia 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Project, which debuted this spring. It's intended to become a network of academics encompassing the entire state.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The idea is that, any time a leader in the state wants to work this issue, now or in the future, from the Republican side or the Democratic side, they should have a team of folks to turn to, ready to roll with information at their fingertips," Rochberg said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I asked him whether any Republicans, from Gov. Nathan Deal to U.S. Sens. Johnny Isakson or David Per-due, or GOP members of the U.S. House, had expressed any interest. Not yet, Rochberg said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But he is optimistic, and noted two "small but important" messages from Georgia's state government.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In 2015, the wildlife division of the state Department of Natural Resources produced a report on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone 's impact on animal species throughout the state.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last November, DNR convened a "
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  ready" conference. "We know that sea level's rising. To not prepare for it is really not a responsible course of action, no matter what your political inclinations," Spud Woodward, director of DNR's coastal resources division, was quoted as saying afterward.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That conference, Rochberg said, "was a signal that the state is willing to convene a conversation around this, despite the politically charged nature of the issue."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The needle that's being threaded here: Conversations about the effects of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  may be necessary --especially when crop losses, flooding, or other observable effects are involved. Dialogue about the causes remains off-limits, for that could also lead to a discussion of remedies. And that's where the polarization starts.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rochberg is kicking around the idea of inviting 50 conservative and 50 liberal students to Emory next spring, to see if some common ground on the topic might be found.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Just in time for the 2018 hurricane season.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Hundreds of North Atlanta High School students walked out Thursday as part of worldwide protests focusing on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  dangers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The rally, held in a field near the school, was approved by Atlanta Public Schools administrators. But a large group of students who joined the protesters interrupted their classmates' speeches with several bursts of "USA" chants and booing.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Student activists tried to carry on with their prepared remarks, urging students to pay attention to what they said is a crisis.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We are the leaders of the younger generation, and we have the opportunity to tell everyone that we are going to ruin the Earth if we do not step up and say something now," said Danielle Milburn, an 18-year-old senior who helped organize the event.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The North Atlanta event is part of the Global 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Strike, happening Sept. 20-27. Students in the United States and other countries have walked out of school last week and this week to bring attention to the consequences of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and call for action. The strike has been promoted by 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last Friday, hundreds of adults and students gathered at the state Capitol bearing a similar message.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 APS administrators agreed to let students hold the event during the school day and worked with students to develop a plan. APS took a similar stance in March 2018, when the district allowed students to leave class to protest gun violence after a mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school. Those protests were part of a nationwide school walkout movementand garnered widespread participation across metro Atlanta.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "In keeping with Atlanta Public Schools' long-standing support of student advocacy and allowing them to engage in safe, structured, student-led civic activities around national dialogues, APS supports students who plan to participate in national student walkouts intended to raise awareness about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," district spokesman Ian Smith said in a written statement.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 North Atlanta students who supported the walkout carried signs that said, "There is no planet B" and "The 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  why aren't we?" Gillian Schuh, a 17-year-old senior, held a sign that read, "I bet the dinosaurs thought they had time too."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 She said she tries to stay informed about environmental concerns and is working to 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  some of her habits.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I think it's important that people understand how drastic the situation is," she said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Cole Bickerstaff, a 17-yearold senior who helped organize the protest, urged students to take small steps to help the environment.He suggested recycling, carpooling and eating less meat.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Not every student at the walkout was there to call for environmental action. A couple of students held signs that said, "extend lunch"and "free parking passes." Chants and shouts from other students sometimes drowned out the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  demonstrators but didn't appear to have a specific focus.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Soleil Golden, a 17-year-old senior and president of the high school's environmental club, said she was prepared for some students "to heckle."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We knew that something like that was going to happen. A lot of kids were just going to step out just so they could get out of class, but, honestly, I'm really glad that we got our message across," she said.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Weather Channel anchor Sam Champion will emcee an upcoming luncheon concerning 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The event, presented by Mothers and Others for Clean Air, a program of the American Lung Association in Georgia, is called Our 
\f1\i\b \ul Changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Is 
\f1\i\b \ul Changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Our Weather: How We Can Protect Our Families. It will be held from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Oct. 3 at the St. Regis hotel in Buckhead.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Our 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is predicted to increase temperatures, which is likely to increase ozone pollution," the group said. "Ozone is a well-known trigger for asthma attacks and is linked to a greater risk of premature death in adults and diminished lung capacity. And we are likely to see more pollen and mold affecting children with allergies. We know, as mothers, parents and caregivers, that all of our children are especially vulnerable to air pollution and allergens."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In addition to lunch and a silent auction, the event will feature a discussion with a panel of experts, including Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgia's Atmospheric Sciences Program and past president of the American Meteorological Society; George Luber, an epidemiologist and an associate director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Heather McTeer Toney, regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency's southeast region; and Dr. Jennifer Shih, a physician and assistant professor in the Department of Medicine and the Department of Pediatrics at Emory University Hospital and School of Medicine.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Guests also will hear from 14-year-old Mikayla Wiseman, who will discuss how air pollution impacts her asthma.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The event is being spearheaded by philanthropists Laura Turner Seydel, Stephanie Blank, Lisa Rayner and Andrea Young.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Key sponsors include the Weather Channel and the American Lung Association in Georgia, along with Marianne Clark, Enid Draluck, Steve Eaton, Turia Gumpert, Donna Hyland, Su Longman, Clare and Nigel Richardson, and Nina Schwartz.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Table hosts include Wendy Babchin and Lyn Ross, Ann Cramer and Ann Curry, Maxine and Dottie Hyland, and Anne Mellinger-Birdsong and Dr. Yasmin Tyler-Hill.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Table-host sponsorships, which include 10 seats, start at $750. For more information, see mothersandothersforcleanair.org/event-enlightenment-luncheon or call 770-544-0508.

\f1\i\b\fs20 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is a myth invented by the Chinese government to undermine U.S. manufacturing, at least according to Donald Trump.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f3\fs20 \cf0 If so, those Chinese are tricky dudes. Among other things, they've apparently hacked into computers at NASA, which has announced that globally, July of 2016 was the hottest month ever recorded. That followed June of 2016, which was the hottest June ever recorded, just as May was the hottest May and April the hottest April. Every month since last October has been the hottest such month ever recorded, and once the data are final, August may become the 11th consecutive month to join that list.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The evidence doesn't stop there. Last year, 2015, was the hottest year ever recorded globally. The previous champion had been 2014. According to Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, there's a 99 percent chance that 2016 will top both of them, producing three consecutive years of record heat globally.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And a global phenomenon is being felt locally as well.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Down along the Georgia coast, rising sea levels are causing widespread alarm from officials who had previously denied the existence of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Scientists at 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Central predict that under moderate sea-rise assumptions, record flooding of at least 3 feet above high tide will strike the Georgia coast by 2040, affecting billions of dollars in property and more than 170,000 acres.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Under high-range projections, floods exceeding 4 feet -- a level not seen in the past 100 years -- become every-year events by 2060" all along the Georgia coast, the study warns. Savannah, Sea Island, Tybee Island -- all would be threatened.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In south Georgia, longtime farmers report weather patterns never before witnessed, and researchers warn that native plants and animals will have to migrate northward, and quickly, to escape the heat. "A lot of them are going to have a hard time," says Jenny McGuire, a research scientist at Georgia Tech and co-author of a new report on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  adaptability. "For plants and animals in the East, there is a higher potential for extinction due to an inability to adapt to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . We have a high diversity of amphibians and other species that are going to struggle."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And of course, the drought has returned. 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  models have long predicted that global warming would create more intense drought and fewer but more intense rain events here in the Southeast, and that's the pattern that seems to be occurring.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Those models also predict that higher levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would keep the heat from dissipating at night, producing many more evenings in which the air conditioners keep humming. Through Sept. 13, we have experienced a record 58 consecutive days in which overnight temperatures have remained above 70 degrees, according to the National Weather Service office in Peachtree City. The last time we enjoyed temperatures in the 60s was on June 21. Here in Atlanta, we've so far endured 82 days of temperatures exceeding 90 degrees. The annual average is 37 days.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In short, we have a whole world of evidence -- literally -- that global 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is real and serious. And yet sheer cussedness still stifles effective action.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 The national report on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  that ripped through the headlines this week offers Georgians some solace, ample cause for anxiety and, of course, endless fodder for debate.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It foresees widespread coastal flooding across the Southeast due to rising sea levels, but says Georgia's coast is less vulnerable than some. It says temperatures will rise, causing more extreme heat events that affect public health, agriculture, energy and forestry. And it predicts that competition will intensify for surface water in watersheds such as the Chattahoochee River basin.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The report, commissioned by Congress, is the third of its type. It represents the combined work of hundreds of scientists, including some in Georgia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Its release was greeted by high praise and sharp denunciations from predictable quarters --- much of it from speakers who admitted they had yet to read the report's 800-plus pages.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Jenna Garland, a spokeswoman for the Sierra Club in Atlanta, applauded the document as a call to action produced by top scientists. "In Georgia, families are already paying the cost of extreme weather and health risks fueled by 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  destruction," she said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But Dewey Lee, an agronomist at the University of Georgia who also serves as executive director of the state's corn growers association, said its members are likely to place more stock in the wisdom borne of experience.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I think it'll take a while for people to separate the politics of this out," Lee said, noting that it's a government report. "If you were to ... talk to farmers who've been through 50 seasons, 60 seasons, they'd tell you, 'Ma'am, every season's different,'" Lee said. "
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ? It always happens. We always struggle with drought. With heavy rainfalls. With cold. With freeze."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Even within the Georgia Tech faculty, responses were mixed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Judith Curry, chairwoman of Tech's school of earth and atmospheric sciences, does believe 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is happening and that people's actions are contributing to it. But she said the report stripped the issue of its nuance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The phrase '
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ' is now officially meaningless," Curry wrote in her blog. "The report effectively implies that there is no 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  other than what is caused by humans."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Michael Chang, the deputy director of Tech's Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems, said that from what he's heard, "I'd have to say it sounded consistent with other reports that have been done in the past." While 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  may vary naturally, he said, "the question is: Are we also beginning to see more extreme events," such as storms, cold snaps and heat waves?"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rather than dismiss the report because some of those questions remain unanswered, he said, Georgia scientists and policymakers would be wise to concentrate on filling the knowledge gaps. "If they're important, are we prepared to address them or adapt to them in a responsible way?"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Gerrit Hoogenboom, a professor of agrometeorology at Washington State University who has projected the impact of rising temperatures on Georgia farmers, didn't question the scientific rigor of the report. And he has no question that farmers need to be preparing for extreme weather events, or that people need to generate less pollution. But he had "mixed feelings" about the report overall, he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For one thing, like much scientific prognosticating these days, it relies on computer models to predict what will happen in the decades ahead. And he is uneasy with people relying on those models too much, because he knows their strengths and weaknesses all too well: His own work is based on them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In fact, Hoogenboom's work is the basis for one of the report's more dramatic assertions about Georgia: that by 2020, corn yields could decline by 15 percent and wheat yields by 20 percent.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Those numbers, however, were published more than a decade ago, looking ahead 20 years, he said. Newer data shows they "may be too drastic," Hoogenboom said. He still believes 2020 yields will show a decline, but a smaller one.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Matthias Ruth, a professor at Northeastern University who studies ecological economics, said such concerns miss the point. Ruth contributed to other parts of the report, and in the past has done independent research on the impact of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  on Georgia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Certainly computers' predictions are imperfect, he said. But they are the best tool available, and the general conclusions of this and previous reports have been borne out by experience, he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Even if we quibble over the odd number here or there, the trends are there, and they're actually accelerating faster than we anticipated," Ruth said. "The longer we wait to make these adjustments, the more 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  we have committed ourselves to, and the more serious the repercussions will be."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Word for word
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The latest report of the U.S. National 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Assessment mentions Atlanta and Georgia directly several times. Here is what it says:
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 TEMPERATURES
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans and Tampa have already had increases in the number of days with temperatures exceeding 95 degrees, during which the number of deaths is above average.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 WATER AVAILABILITY
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Water resources in the Southeast are abundant and support heavily populated urban areas, rural communities, unique ecosystems, and economies based on agriculture, energy and tourism. The region also experiences extensive droughts, such as the 2007 drought in Atlanta that created water conflicts among three states.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Appalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River basin in Georgia, Alabama and Florida supports a wide range of water uses and the regional economy, creating challenging water-sharing tradeoffs for the basin stakeholders. 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  presents new stresses and uncertainties.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Because of Clayton County's innovative water recycling project during the 2008 drought, they were able to maintain reservoirs at near capacity and an abundant supply of water while neighboring Lake Lanier, the water supply for Atlanta, was at record lows.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Groundwater withdrawals are intense in parts of the Southwest and Northwest, the Great Plains, Mississippi Valley, Florida and South Georgia, and near the Great Lakes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 AGRICULTURE
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The 2007 drought cost the Georgia agriculture industry $339 in crop losses ... In Georgia, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  projections indicate corn yields could decline by 15% and wheat yields by 20% through 2020. In addition, many fruit crops from long-lived trees and bushes require chilling periods and may need to be replaced in a warming

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Five years ago, the National Audubon Society released an alarming study forecasting danger from 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  for 314 bird species that occur in North America. Several of them, the report said, likely will be extinct by 2080.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Dozens of the species cited in the study occur in Georgia, including the bald eagle, osprey, whip-poor-will, scarlet tanager, wild turkey, orchard oriole, wood thrush, hairy woodpecker, nuthatches, sparrows, several warbler species and others.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Based on U.N. 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  projections and hundreds of thousands of hours of "citizen-science" observations, including Christmas Bird Counts, the Audubon study predicted that if 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  continues at its expected rate, it likely will force vulnerable birds into smaller spaces or drive them to find new places to live, feed and nest over the next 65 years. As a
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 result, many bird populations likely will be decimated, including extinction for some species.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Now, Audubon is conducting a nationwide pilot program, called 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch, to test and fine-tune the predictions. The Atlanta Audubon Society (AAS) is part of the project, which began two years ago and is designed to help researchers determine if birds are shifting their ranges, habitats and other behaviors in response to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In Atlanta, 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch volunteers are focusing on the Eastern bluebird and brown-headed, white-breasted and red-breasted nuthatches, said Adam Betuel, AAS's conservation director. Between now and Feb. 15, volunteers will conduct one
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 dozen five-minute point counts in assigned areas to record all bluebirds and nuthatches seen or heard.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f3\fs20 \cf0 (An ability to identify the birds by sound is helpful but not required.)
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 IN THE SKY: From David Dundee, Tellus Museum astronomer: A total lunar eclipse of January's full moon (called the "Snow Moon" or "Wolf Moon") will occur in Atlanta on Sunday beginning at 10:33 p.m., with full eclipse by 11:40 p.m-- and ending at 12:43 a.m. Monday.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Venus rises in the east a few hours before dawn. Venus and Jupiter will appear close together before dawn on Monday. Mars is low in the southwest at dusk. Jupiter and Saturn are low in the east just before sunrise.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 The summer of 2016 goes down as Atlanta's second-hottest ever with its seemingly ceaseless parade of 90-plus degree days.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The nights, though, have been relatively worse.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Saturday is expected to be the first day this summer that Atlanta's low temperature drops below 70 degrees. If so, it has been 73 days -- a record -- since the city felt so cool. The once-typical late-in-the-day cooling-off periods have disappeared, and if future summers mimic this year's, then Atlantans can expect worsening weather, health and ecological problems for decades to come.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 One recent study predicts that by the year 2100, Atlanta will succumbto94dayswhenthehightemperature is at or above 95 degrees. Current average: seven days.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Future weather, of course, is hard to predict. The summer of 2017, for example, may be cooler than 2016 due to the La Nina weather pattern newly ensconced in the Northern Hemisphere. Most climatologists, though, expecttemperaturestowarm over the next century, and they point to man-made carbon dioxide stifling the atmosphere as the main culprit.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "One of the hallmarks of global warming is the rise of extreme heat," said Alyson Kenward, a senior scientist with 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Central, an environmental research nonprofit in New Jersey. "All of a sudden the types of temperatures we think of as being pretty unusual and only happening a handful of times a year will be happening a lot more in the future.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "So the question is," she continued, "how ready are people to face three months of 95-degree weather?"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For climatologists, summer runs from June 1 through Aug. 31. Only Atlanta's summer of 1980 was hotter than 2016, according to National Weather Service records that date to 1887.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 2016 is also shaping up as North Georgia's second-hot-test year ever, behind only 2012. Atlanta's eight warmest years have all come since 1980, proof that Georgia is steadily -- and rapidly -- warming, climatologists say.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Extreme heat, like intense downpours and rising seas, is increasingly linked to global warming. Marshall Shepherd, who runs the University of Georgia's Atmospheric Sciences Program, recently co-authored a National Academy of Sciences study that "overwhelmingly found that extreme heat events have the strongest attribution signal to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The journal Nature 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  also reported last year that the high temperatures three out of every four days can be tied to global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Most Atlantans can easily relate to the number of days (75 this year) when the temperature hit 90 degrees or higher at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and DeKalb-Peachtree Airport. Less known, but potentially of greater significance, is the number of days in a row when the low temperature hasn't fallen below 70 degrees.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This year far surpasses 2010, the previous record-breaking year, when Atlanta registered 55 straight days without the mercury ever dipping below 70. The city's heat is fueled by more than the Earth's overall warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "In general, cities hold heat more at night because of all the concrete. It's an urban effect,"said Pam Knox, UGA's climatologist. "And more widespread humidity seems to be going up, and humidity tends to keep things warmer at night. You really get the coolest nights in summer when it's dry."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Bill Murphey is Knox's counterpart with the state of Georgia. He's also the state's chief meteorologist. Murphey says the lack of wind, due to high pressure systems, also keeps Atlanta hot at night.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We had very few, if any, air mass 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  or frontal systems to help us out," he said. "Hopefully, we'll get some (wind) 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  here in the fall and maybe get a tropical storm system to help us out as far as the dryness goes."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Tropical Storm Hermine cooled temps and replenished reservoirs and aquifers. Yet parts of metro Atlanta and northwest Georgia still suffer "extreme drought," according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "You're likely to see drought more frequently with higher temperatures and higher evaporation (rates) that suck more moisture out of the soil," Knox said. "That puts more stress on plants. It probably makes more farmers convert to irrigation. So there could be water shortages."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Warmer weather might afford farmers longer growing seasons. But high temperatures also bring more pests and invasive species, prompting farmers to spend more on pesticides and herbicides.Mosquitoes, perhaps carrying Zika or malaria, also thrive on warm weather.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Air quality, too, suffers the longer it's hotter. Metro Atlanta, so far, has violated federal air quality standards about three times as much as last year. And it's likely to worsen in the future.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The World 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Research Program, a Switzerland-based nonprofit, expects greenhouse gas emissions to continue unabated through 2100.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 If so, the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is expected to keep warming. And Atlanta will face more than three months each year with temperatures climbing to highs of 95 degrees or more.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "What does that mean for public health?" 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Central's Kenward asked.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "What does that mean for a city's infrastructure? Will people be able to go outside and do any kind of sports activity? Will they even be able to gear up for football season in the summer?"

\f3\fs20 The U.S. Congress has dithered on this issue for far too long. We need a strong, national response to meet urgency of the task.

This is from unreliable ground-based temperature measurement. Satellite temperature measurements are not subject to errors from urban heat island effects. Satellite data, readily available on the Internet, shows April, May, June, July, and August 2016 were cooler than the same months in 1998. Only January, February, and March 2016 were warmer than corresponding months of 1998. And 1998 and 2010 were warmer years than 2015.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 The letter, "Heaven help us if we ignore 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone " ( Jan. 8), prompted me to review a book by Yuval Noah Harari entitled "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind," which has on its cover a recommendation written by Bill Gates. On page 66, Harari says, "Even though Australia's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate changed
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  some 45,000 years ago, it wasn't a remarkable upheaval. It's hard to see how the new weather patterns alone could have caused such a massive extinction. It's common today to explain anything and everything as the result of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , but the truth is that earth's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  never rests. It is in constant flux. ... In particular, our planet has experienced numerous cycles of cooling and warming. During the last million years, there has been an ice age on average every 100,000 years." I would 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  that letter's headline to, "Heaven help us if we ignore the existence of something way bigger than us out there."

\f3\fs20 It's easy for each of us to be a danger to our democracy. All we have to do is stop thinking about the issues and ignore the facts. Just attach ourselves to one political party, philosophy or doctrine and always support it. Close our minds to points of view that are initially contrary to our own. Avoid being labeled a moderate or an independent. Tell our representatives to dig in their heels and never compromise. Treat members of other political parties like enemies. Speak about them using mean, derogatory or hateful speech. Do these things, and we will continue to have the confrontational, no-compromise, dysfunctional national government we now have. Do these things, and we ourselves will be a danger to the best form of government ever devised.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 It didn't take NNaserri Carew-Johnson long to learn how to discern the role the environment played in the length and severity of her asthma attacks or whether she had one at all.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 From the day's pollen count to sudden 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the seasons, she knew to be on high alert and keep her inhaler nearby.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "She learned very early on to police herself," said her mother, Vicki Carew of south Fulton County. "She knows what symptoms to look for and what the triggers are, including 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That alone might put the 16-year-old far ahead of most of us.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While the majority of Americans think of melting snow caps and helpless polar bears sweltering under rising temperatures, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  experts and a growing number of physicians are trying now to shift the conversation away from an environmental and national security issue to one of public health.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Here's why: 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  will, absent other 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , amplify some of the existing health threats the nation now faces, said Dr. George Luber, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and Health Program.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Children like NNaserri, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color are especially vulnerable, he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Some of these effects on health are already underway in the United States," Luber said. "Children, primarily because of physiological and developmental factors, will disproportionately suffer from the effects of heat waves, air pollution, infectious illness, and trauma resulting from extreme weather events."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 According to the Georgia Department of Public Health, nearly 1 in 10 children in Georgia has asthma, and African- American children are twice as likely as white children to have asthma.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Asthma, which affects the lungs' airways, is considered the most chronic condition among children and the No. 1 cause of school absenteeism.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Dr. LeRoy Graham Jr., a pediatric pulmonologist and associate clinical professor at Morehouse School of Medicine, said the prevalence of asthma among Georgia children is now 12 percent, one of the highest in the nation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "When I came in 1993, it was 6-7 percent," Graham said. "It's undeniable that people living in the urban core, concentrated around central transportation corridor are at even greater risk of being diagnosed with asthma and dying from the disease."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Not only is asthma more common in African-Americans, it is more common for all children living in congested urban environments, Graham said. And African-Americans as a group are two to four times more likely to be admitted to the hospital or emergency room for asthma and two times as likely to die of asthma, nationally.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Laura Seydel, who co-founded Mothers & Others for Clean Air with Stephanie Blank, has been working to improve the state's air quality since 2004.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "In the early 2000s, you couldn't turn on the news in the summer without hearing a forecast for a code red or a code purple day for air quality in Atlanta," Seydel said. "In 2014, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America ranked Atlanta 13th among the largest 100 U.S. metro areas as the most challenging place to live with asthma."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Seydel said medical studies confirmed what they already knew --- that air pollution increases the risk of underdeveloped lungs, diminished lung function and other respiratory symptoms in healthy children.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The women founded Mothers & Others for Clean Air, a program of the American Lung Association, to help raise awareness about the negative health impacts of air pollution and to create 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Children should get to be children, and part of being a child is playing outside," Seydel said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Because children like NNaserri, a track and field enthusiast, spend more time outdoors and breathe in more air than adults, they are particularly susceptible to air pollution.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Seydel said that while overall air quality has improved, more needs to be done to ensure everyone can breathe cleaner air every day.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We have learned that even lower levels of air pollution are harmful," she said. "The other threat comes from unregulated carbon emissions, which hurts us all because it contributes to global 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  disruption, leading to rising temperatures, more air pollution, more frequent extreme weather events like we've seen here at home in the Southeast, and contributing to the spread of certain diseases. We are also likely to see more pollen and mold affecting children with allergies."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As she's gotten older, NNaserri has fewer asthma attacks, her mother said, but only because she has remained diligent in sniffing out her triggers, including milk protein and sudden 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the weather.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It's times like these, when we go from winter to summer in one week that always seems to impact her," said Vicki Carew.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Even though 97 percent of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists have concluded that human-caused 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is happening, she and others fear the issue isn't being taken seriously enough.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  or global 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  disruption is a threat to public health --- it's not just about polar bears anymore," Seydel said.

\f3\fs20 Push for slavery reparations is misguided effort
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The demand for reparations for the past practice of slavery goes on despite it being almost impossible to identify just who had ancestors who were slaves in America. Reparations has a dubious foundation, given how the United States passed myriad Great Society programs that actually made Black Americans more dependent on government and led to the effective destruction of the Black family in many instances. New handouts would not address core problems many Black people face, like single-parent families and high levels of crime. These are largely the product of today's welfare state, not slavery. To blame slavery ignores the fact that after the Civil War, the Black family had become quite strong - that is, until the welfare state destroyed it. One could once accurately say the legacy of slavery was damaging to Black America, but now the blame can be placed at the feet of government and the "race hustle" of some Black leaders and the Democratic Party.

\f3\fs20 Agenda-driven scientists want to push U.S. into costly 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  pact.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 By Sarah Palin
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 With the publication of damaging e-mails from a 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  research center in Britain, the radical environmental movement appears to face a tipping point. The revelation of appalling actions by so-called 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  experts allows the American public to finally understand the concerns so many of us have articulated on this issue.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone -gate," as the e-mails and other documents from the 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Research Unit at the University of East Anglia have become known, exposes a highly politicized scientific circle --- the same circle whose work underlies efforts at the Copenhagen 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  conference. The agenda-driven policies being pushed in Copenhagen won't 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  the weather, but they would 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  our economy for the worse.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The e-mails reveal that leading 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  "experts" deliberately destroyed records, manipulated data to "hide the decline" in global temperatures, and tried to silence their critics by preventing them from publishing in peer-reviewed journals. What's more, the documents show that there was no real consensus even within the CRU crowd. Some scientists had strong doubts about the accuracy of estimates of temperatures from centuries ago, estimates used to back claims that more recent temperatures are rising at an alarming rate.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This scandal obviously calls into question the proposals being pushed in Copenhagen. I've always believed that policy should be based on sound science, not politics. As governor of Alaska, I took a stand against politicized science when I sued the federal government over its decision to list the polar bear as an endangered species despite the fact that the polar bear population had more than doubled. I got clobbered for my actions by radical environmentalists nationwide, but I stood by my view that adding a healthy species to the endangered list under the guise of "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  impacts" was an abuse of the Endangered Species Act.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Our representatives in Copenhagen should remember that good environmental policy-making is about weighing real-world costs and benefits --- not pursuing a political agenda. That's not to say I deny the reality of some 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  --- far from it. I saw the impact of 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  weather patterns firsthand while serving as governor of our only Arctic state.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But while we recognize the occurrence of these natural, cyclical environmental trends, we can't say with assurance that man's activities cause weather 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . We can say, however, that any potential benefits of proposed emissions reduction policies are far outweighed by their economic costs. And those costs are real. Unlike the proposals China and India offered prior to Copenhagen --- which actually allow them to increase their emissions --- President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions. Meeting such targets would require Congress to pass its cap-and-tax plans, which will result in job losses and higher energy costs. That's not exactly what most Americans are hoping for these days. And as public opposition continues to stall Congress' cap-and-tax legislation, Environmental Protection Agency bureaucrats plan to regulate carbon emissions themselves, doing an end run around the American people.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In his inaugural address, President Obama declared his intention to "restore science to its rightful place." But instead of staying home from Copenhagen and sending a message that the United States will not be a party to fraudulent scientific practices, the president has upped the ante. He plans to fly in at the climax of the conference in hopes of sealing a "deal." Whatever deal he gets, it will be no deal for the American people. What Obama really hopes to bring home from Copenhagen is more pressure to pass the Democrats' cap-and-tax proposal. This is a political move. The last thing America needs is misguided legislation that will raise taxes and cost jobs --- particularly when the push for such legislation rests on agenda-driven science.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Without trustworthy science, Americans should be wary about what comes out of this politicized conference. The president should boycott Copenhagen.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Sarah Palin was the 2008 Republican nominee for vice president and governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 No.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A few leaked e-mails can't 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  the consensus of science.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 By Alan I. Leshner
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Don't be fooled about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  science. In April, 1994 --- long after scientists had clearly demonstrated the addictive quality and devastating health impacts of cigarette smoking --- seven chief executives of major tobacco companies denied the evidence, swearing under oath that nicotine was not addictive.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Now, the American public is again being subjected to those kinds of denials, this time about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . While Sarah Palin wrote that she did not deny the "reality of some 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," she distorted the scientific evidence that Earth's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , largely as a result of human behaviors. She also badly confused the concepts of daily weather 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and long-term 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  trends when she wrote that "while we recognize the occurrence of these natural, cyclical environmental trends, we can't say with assurance that man's activities cause weather 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ." Her statement inaccurately suggests that short-term weather fluctuations must be consistent with long-term 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  patterns. And it is the long-term patterns that are a cause for concern.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\i\b\fs20 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  science is clear: The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide --- derived mostly from the human activities of fossil-fuel burning and deforestation --- stands at 389 parts per million. We know from studying ancient Antarctic ice cores that this concentration is higher than it has been for at least the past 650,000 years. Exhaustive measurements tell us that atmospheric carbon dioxide is rising by 2 ppm every year and that the global temperature has increased by about 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century. Multiple lines of other evidence, including reliable thermometer readings since the 1880s, reveal a clear warming trend. The broader impacts of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  range from rapidly melting glaciers and rising sea levels to shifts in species ranges.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Already, sea levels are estimated to rise by 1 to 2 meters by the end of this century. Some scientists have said that average temperatures could jump by as much as 4 degrees Fahrenheit if the atmospheric carbon dioxide level reaches 450 ppm. We may face even more dangerous impacts at 550 ppm, and above that level, devastating events. U.S. crop productivity would be affected, and European communities might suffer increased fatalities because of intensely hot summers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Doubters insist that the Earth is not warming. This is in stark contrast to the consensus of 18 of the world's most respected scientific organizations, who stated in an Oct. 21 letter to the U.S. Senate that human-induced 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is real. Doubters also make selective use of evidence, noting that the warming of the late 1990s did not persist from 2001 to 2008, while ignoring the fact that the first decade of the 21st century looks like it will be the warmest one on record.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 None of these tactics 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  the clear consensus of a vast majority of scientists, who agree that the Earth is warming as greenhouse gas levels rise. The public and policy-makers should not be confused by a few private e-mails that are being selectively publicized and, in any case, remain irrelevant to the broad body of diverse evidence on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Selected language in the messages has been interpreted by some to suggest unethical actions such as data manipulation or suppression. To be sure, investigations are appropriate whenever questions are raised regarding the transparency and rigor of the scientific process or the integrity of individual scientists. But it is wrong to suggest that apparently stolen e-mails, deployed on the eve of the Copenhagen 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  summit, somehow refute a century of evidence based on thousands of studies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Palin also errs by claiming that America can't afford to reduce greenhouse gases. The highly regarded Stern Commission revealed that inaction could cost us the equivalent of between 5 percent and 20 percent of global gross domestic product per year. In contrast, the price of slowing emissions was estimated to be 1 percent of GDP. China, meanwhile, reportedly is investing heavily in clean energy technologies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Now, policy-makers must decide whether to act on the evidence or to avoid facing one of the most crucial issues of our generation.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 I read about an elderly lady who fell and hit her head on the sidewalk. A woman rushed over with an umbrella to shield the lady from the sun, while a man retrieved a jacket from his car to cushion her head.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Another woman came out of a restaurant with a bucket of cool water and a rag to place on the woman's forehead, while someone else provided towels beneath her arms.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The woman who fell was white, while the various helpers were African-American, white, Hispanic and Asian. Rather than debating whether she was worthy of their help, they put into practice what we would call human decency and compassion.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In the story of the Good Samaritan, many people ignore a man lying by the roadside, who has been robbed and wounded by thieves. Perhaps they were too busy or maybe they didn't like his looks.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The man who finally stops to help sees the fellow as his neighbor, despite racial or religious differences. Christ pointed to the Samaritan as an example for us: "Go and do likewise."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Notice Christ didn't say to first check whether the victim was rich or poor, conservative or liberal, atheist or believer. I can't imagine him suggesting we find out the victim's stance on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , abortion, immigration or tax reform.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Our country is so divided that some family members have stopped talking with each other, because their political beliefs are different. I know a grandmother who no longer hears from her grandson, because he has deemed her too conservative.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some social media posts drip with venomous hatred toward anyone with a contrasting viewpoint. Reasoned, respectful discussion has succumbed to furious tweets, angry name-calling and in some cases, riots.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 There is a gorgeous poem "As Kingfishers Catch Fire," that includes the line: "Christ plays in ten thousand places," suggesting we find God everywhere. In many monasteries, every stranger that knocks on the door is welcomed as another Christ, because he said, "I was a stranger and you welcomed me."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For many of us, the wounded stranger on the roadside stands for people who are different from us because of their color, religion or social class. The stranger also symbolizes the relatives and friends we've left behind because of conflicting political beliefs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Would you help a guy wearing a Republican party hat? Would you help a woman wearing a shirt showing support for the Democratic party? Christ asked a soul-stir-ring question: "What good does it do if a man gains the whole world, but loses his soul?"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We can tailor this to contemporary times: "What is the point of having the best job, the poshest home and the fanciest car, if we turn our back on others?"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We are all made in the image of God, no matter what our color, ethnic background -- or political stance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We become the best versions of ourselves, when we act with human decency and compassion, extended to everyone, despite differences.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And let's face it -- if the Good Samaritans who saw the old woman on the sidewalk had decided to find out which political party she supported before helping her, she might still be lying there.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Donald Trump's victory for president can be said, "Make Energy In America Great Again." Contrasts between Trump and Clinton energy policies are the greatest in American elections. The Republican Party platform contained this statement on energy--" Since energy is both an economic and national security issue, we support enactment of policies to increase domestic energy production, including public lands." The Democrat Platform called for, "reducing greenhouse gas emissions more than 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. We believe America must be running entirely on clean energy by mid-century." Clinton supported stopping constructing the Keystone XL pipeline; while Trump said he would restart construction. The new Trump administration enables the nation to create millions of jobs producing coal, oil and natural gas; add possibly a trillion dollars annually to our gross national product; and enhance our nation's global prestige by using energy supply to threaten aggressive nations.

\f3\fs20 America has decided. Donald Trump will be our next president. Now it is time for us all to come together and push America forward. For those of you that have read my letters before, you know that action on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change

\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Certainly I will try and give him every chance to succeed, for his success is America's success. I will probably write him many letters about

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Georgia's salt marsh is disappearing, according to UGA scientists, and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is the main culprit.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Researchers at the University of Georgia's Marine Institute on Sapelo Island used satellite imagery over three decades to show that the amount of Spartina alternifolora, or cordgrass, has diminished by 35 percent.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The recently released study largely blames 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  with its higher temperatures, on land and in the oceans, and prolonged droughts. The loss of vegetation will ripple through the salt marsh ecosystem.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "A decrease in the growth of marsh plants likely affects all of the animals that depend on the marsh, such as juvenile shrimp and crabs, which use the marsh as a nursery," said Merryl Alber, director of the Marine Institute. "These decreases in vegetation may also affect other marsh services, such as stabilizing the shoreline, filtering pollutants and protecting against storm damage."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rising seas, another byproduct of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , pushes salt water further inland, harming the delicate salt-fresh water balance critical for coastal critters and vegetation. Numerous studies predict a minimum 3-foot rise of the Atlantic Ocean off Georgia by 2100.

All these triggers and the issues they invoke, backed by mounting evidence of irreversible risks to humankind, are converging in Copenhagen.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Our collective political will may yet secure the Earth's equilibrium through an overarching deal --- although short of a treaty --- by the end of the U.N. 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  conference. Or it could all come unglued. Delegates chosen to decide our fate deliberately have removed the one element that can tip the scales.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We know fossil fuel emissions matter immensely. But the most volatile chemical compound isn't methane, nitrous oxide or even carbon dioxide. It's water.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Scientists stress water's profound link with 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , and how wise water management could bind global efforts to cool our warming planet with local efforts to absorb its unavoidable shocks. Even the public gets it. Yet our delegates wallow in denial. In a misguided effort to avoid dissent, they have erased water from their working draft, forgetting how water is the planet's one common denominator.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Start with the atmosphere. Climatologists differ on some science but agree on this: The most potent greenhouse gas --- more than double the impact of carbon dioxide --- is water vapor. As CO2 begins to concentrate, global warming rapidly evaporates more surface moisture. Up there, rapidly accumulating water vapor magnifies the greenhouse effect.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Back down here, water is also the medium for adapting to those greenhouse effects that are well underway. Virtually every effect we dread --- urban heat waves, melting snowpack, longer droughts, increased wildfires, drying reservoirs, rising sea levels, desiccating soils --- boils down to the loss of fresh water. Even regions feeling more sudden, torrential rain can't use their extreme runoff; to absorb unpredictable floods, dam operators must empty reservoirs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 So whenever we say 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  volatility, we really mean water volatility.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That truth goes beyond semantics. The lack of secure water unravels development as billions lose access to clean, healthy lifelines. Unstable water undermines food security because of drier farms, eroded topsoil and diminished irrigation. And it cripples energy security, with less water to turn turbines, cool nukes, pump oil or boil into steam for generation by coal, solar and geothermal plants.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Geopolitical concerns alone should compel Copenhagen's delegates to make water adaptation strategies their top priority. But rather than defuse it as a threat multiplier, or integrate it in coping mechanisms, negotiators surgically deleted all references to water from the draft text.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some estimate that for every thousand clean-energy- and carbon-mitigation-obsessed delegates descending on Copenhagen, fewer than a dozen deal with adaptation through water. Having dehydrated the negotiations, no one can discuss how all the planet's thirsty species, including 6.8 billion humans, will cope with the water volatility that is inevitable even if all emissions ended today.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Yet even as delegates repress water's strategic import, the world does not. A Pew Research poll found that, over the past 18 months, Americans' concern about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  has evaporated from 44 percent to 35 percent; a GlobeScan/Circle of Blue international survey found 87 percent of those polled worried about increasing freshwater shortages, up 5 percentage points from 2003. The inverted priorities reveal three things.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 First, to regain public trust and re-establish their democratic legitimacy, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  delegates must restore water to its rightful place at the fulcrum of decisions. If voters don't fully value the invisible, silent and delayed effect of burning coal and gasoline, they definitely grasp how humans both affect and depend on an increasingly volatile water cycle. In the face of extreme instability, society demands a route to resilience.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Second, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  resilience can't be regulated from above but can be encouraged to emerge from below --- through water. Water can be more securely stored in the efficient "natural infrastructure" of flood plains, groundwater and aquifers, rather than sacrificed to the sun in shallow evaporation reservoirs. Human ingenuity can be tapped through judicious conservation incentives that instill a stronger sense of local water ownership in us all.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Finally, water must be the delegates' most compelling political catalyst. Even 
\f1\i\b \ul climate

\f3\fs20 \cf0 If you lose a couple of toes to frostbite this morning, all Marshall Shepherd asks is this: Don't blame the polar vortex.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The previous deep freeze could be attributed to that mystical force spiraling over the North Pole. The current one is just a traditional, run-of-the-mill cold snap.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 If Shepherd seems a little touchy about it, you can't blame him. The University of Georgia professor has spent a good part of this month trying to rescue the phrase from a tug of war between Rush Limbaugh and the White House.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Putting out such fires --- protecting his science, in other words --- has been his job for the past year as president of the American Meteorological Society.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The latest incident began with the dry, cold blast that shattered pipes, killed plants and closed schools across metro Atlanta --- and much of the Eastern United States. Limbaugh pronounced the explanation for the weather to be part of the leftist, global-warming conspiracy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Do you know what the polar vortex is? Have you ever heard of it? Well, they just created it for this week," the conservative radio provocateur said that cold Monday. "Wackos are saying it's a great example of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Believe it or not, the White House listens to Limbaugh.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Two days later, John Holdren, President Barack Obama's science adviser, was featured in a YouTube video. "A growing body of evidence suggests that the kind of extreme cold being experienced by much of the United States, as we speak, is a pattern we can see with increasing frequency as global warming continues," Holdren said --- after throwing in a few caveats.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Enter Shepherd as referee. Limbaugh was dead wrong, the AMS president said. But the White House "was a bit heavy-handed as well," he said in an interview this week.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A bit of background: The polar vortex has had an official presence in the meteorological lexicon since 1959. Limbaugh's lack of exposure notwithstanding, references date further, to the 1940s, Shepherd said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Think of a jet stream of cold air that circles above the North Pole (and the South Pole, too) like water around a drain. Every now and then, a piece of the vortex runs off track --- freezing the bejeezus out of everyone in its wake.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The question is why. The White House cited research that points to Earth's increasing temperature as a counterintuitive reason for that particular dose of arctic air.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Like most scientists, Shepherd believes the data overwhelmingly supports global warming --- which has now been rechristened as 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . But in politics, 80 percent certainty is called a landslide. In science, it's a call for more data.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 So Shepherd, unlike the Obama administration, wasn't quite ready to tie the hot topic of global warming to a rampaging polar vortex.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I think it's actually quite plausible, but from my lens, it's a bit too early to completely anchor that as a conclusive reason," Shepherd said in a White House-sponsored conversation of experts on the Internet.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Shepherd's term as president of the American Meteorological Society ends next month with a five-day conference at the Georgia World Congress Center. He will leave his post as he entered it --- concerned about the gap between what science has proved and what the general public is prepared to believe.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "In this state, it's still a bit tricky," Shepherd said. Georgia doesn't compare to North Carolina, where state lawmakers forbade discussions of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . "But I still think there are some challenges," he added.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 There is the general frustration when it comes to the acceptance of global warming. Shepherd's message for those who point to the continued existence of cold weather: Just because it's night, you can't argue that the sun has disappeared.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But there's more to his worry. A great deal of on-the-ground data is being generated as well, which will need to be absorbed by your city, county and state governments. Because global warming is coming to your neighborhood.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Shepherd said one of his doctoral students is about to publish a paper showing a substantial increase in extreme weather events around Atlanta that can be tied to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . The same study picks out counties that will be particularly vulnerable to drought in South Georgia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Then there's the Georgia coast. I asked Shepherd whether residents there had accepted the fact that sea levels are rising --- another consequence of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . He referred me to Charles Hopkinson, another UGA professor and director of the Georgia Sea Grant College Program.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We've spent the last five years working with communities to get them to rethink their vulnerability to flood and rising waters," Hopkinson said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It is possible that the closer you live to big water, the more likely it is you believe in global warming. Hopkinson said his group is finishing up a study for Tybee Island, near Savannah, on the impact that rising sea levels will have on that community.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The community of St. Marys, farther south, is interested, too. All have felt the impact of skyrocketing costs for federally subsidized flood insurance. Make the right preparations and file the right paperwork, and everybody in the community gets a 5 percent break on flood insurance, Hopkinson said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This is how ideological barriers are breached in America. We don't have to believe in science. We have insurance companies to do that for us.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Yes: Tough caps would likely curb pollution and cool warming
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 By William Buzbee and Victor B. Flatt
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Congress is beginning to grapple with 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Reps. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) have introduced a bill that would establish a cap-and-trade mechanism for significant reductions in U.S. global warming emissions. The bill is smart and comprehensive, covering energy, fuels, cars and more. Despite some shortcomings, it's a good place to start the discussion about how to fix the most serious environmental problem the planet has ever faced.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Polluting industries have mounted a scare campaign to persuade us that it's too severe, will cost jobs, choke the economy --- the same complaints we hear every time industry worries about being inconvenienced. But the truth is that in important ways, the bill doesn't go far enough.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The core of the bill is a cap-and-trade system, under which big polluters will acquire allowances that would permit them to emit greenhouse gases --- carbon dioxide, for example. If polluters emit less than anticipated, they can sell excess "credits" to other polluters, who can use them to effectively raise their own caps. The question is where the caps are set, and the bill ultimately sets the cap considerably above the levels recommended by scientists and international negotiators. The effort will be for naught if developing countries such as China balk at emissions targets because they believe the United States isn't shouldering its fair share.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The bill also embraces the sorts of offsets we've already seen in the markets, where a product's associated greenhouse gases are "offset" by carbon absorption from say, planting trees. Polluters could buy carbon offsets --- from wind farms, for example --- and use the saved emissions as a credit against their own emissions. The bill also discounts offset-created pollution rights with respect to ordinary allowances. This gives polluters sound incentives to cut their own emissions, and it adjusts offset credits to account for risks that offsets aren't as beneficial as hoped. But the bill needs to do better to ensure that environmental harms associated with offsets can be addressed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Industry is hoping that a federal bill will have a generous cap and that it will preempt state efforts. Waxman-Markey would indeed require states to surrender their own cap-and-trade markets for five years, but otherwise preserves the possibility of state legislation. In addition, the draft bill's language needs to be strengthened to ensure states retain their usual powers to otherwise protect their citizens and the environment. Without such clarification, wasteful litigation over retained state power is likely.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 One reason a cap-and-trade scheme makes sense is that it doesn't really matter where carbon emissions occur; it's the cumulative effect that matters. Unfortunately, the co-pollutants that go up the smokestack with carbon dioxide can have a severe impact on nearby communities, and those communities are usually poor. And since some polluters will accumulate credits or offsets allowing them to burn more fuel, there's good reason to worry about "hot spots" where co-pollutants get out of control.

\f1\i\b \ul climate change

\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is upon us, and Waxman-Markey could be the vehicle by which the United States finally takes action.

\f3\fs20 No: Caps could hinder jobs, energy sector in U.S. economy
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 By Donald Hertzmark
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Congress is about to debate a bill that promises to remake the most fundamental resource in the U.S. economy: energy. In this, we might learn a few things:
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 * Energy is the largest sector of the U.S. economy, even greater than the primary energy output of the Middle East, including the Persian Gulf oil producers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 * Jobs that leave the U.S. because of cap and trade will result in more pollution worldwide than if those jobs remained here.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 * The revenue base for cap and trade is only temporary, as the bill promises to kill the industries that fund the permits.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 * The replacement jobs in renewable energy pay far less than do the jobs in primary energy and manufacturing that will be lost.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As California has shown, premature zeal about carbon dioxide reductions can be a big job killer. For states with a lot of heavy industry and power generation, cap-and-trade legislation, in which 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  costs would be distributed across regions and income groups, is likely to force wholesale shifts in economic activity. But where will these jobs go? And will the world's environment be better or worse off?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 All indications are that cap-and-trade will lead to wholesale shifts in jobs to nonparticipating countries that decline to sign a 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  treaty. China is a nonparticipant. When industry moves to China, its carbon dioxide emissions will go up compared to the U.S. China's economy as a whole uses about twice as much energy per dollar of GDP as the U.S. manufacturing sector. This means that energy-related emissions will double or more due to this shift in activity. Moreover, since China relies on coal for almost 70 percent of its primary energy, compared to 32 percent in the United States, not only carbon dioxide, but many other emissions will more than double.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A skilled U.S. workforce will eventually find something else to make. Unfortunately, as a recent University of Massachusetts study found, the average wage in "green energy" jobs is about 65 percent of that in the industrial and energy jobs that are lost.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Alas, only the lawyers will do well, for cap-and-trade promises to ignite a global trade war, one already promised by Secretary of Energy Steven Chu. The cap-and-trade bill specifically permits the government to levy carbon fees on imports from non-complying countries, such as China. Such duties are contrary to world trade agreements and will lead to endless litigation and, possibly, a trade war with China, our country's largest creditor.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Europe tried cap-and-trade for its carbon dioxide program a few years back, allocating permits by firm and industry. For a few years there was a thriving market in these tradable permits, mostly to sell excess carbon dioxide permits, purchased from firms that had not used up their allowances, or to "offset" emissions in Europe with reductions in other countries, by investing in various clean energy projects elsewhere. When it was discovered that the initial allocation of permits had been far higher than Europe's industries actually generated, the price of permits collapsed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Proponents in the U.S. claim that they have learned these lessons. Perhaps, but are we really serious about tacking on new costs to already struggling industries such as autos and primary metals? Or will we find a way to make special considerations for weak industries, and regions, and states? And pretty soon we will be back to the European system that reduced carbon dioxide by not one bit, but produced a whirlwind of regulations and trading activity.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Credit goes to South Carolina Republican Bob Inglis who is taking a bipartisan approach to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  through his recent Three American Questions campaign ( "It's Bipartisan or Bust for Ex-lawmaker," News, April 11).
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This all-too scarce approach by some of our public leadership is a welcome attitude shift that is sorely needed. The Pentagon considers 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  a threat multiplier, exacerbating challenges such as national security and draining domestic resources. Considering the gravity and range of problems created by degrading "our common home," stopping the squabbling and starting a serious adult discussion is long overdue.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Students at Jenkins High School in Savannah are building a new system that will help their community cope with flood patterns that have 
\f1\i\b \ul changed
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  with the rise in global temperatures.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Teenagers in the school's engineering class are building water level sensors that can produce data for rescuers and residents.While others protest government policy or argue about whether 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is real, they are taking a hands-on approach.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "There are so many speculations, and we want to make sure we're doing something right now," said Udai Mallepoola, 17. He and more than two dozen students are part of a project established by Georgia Tech academics and local officials.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The goals: establish an early warning system for floods and build a database that informs long-term planning.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Tech computing research scientist Russell Clark has a house in an old coastal neighborhood that used to be sheltered from storm surges. That 
\f1\i\b \ul changed
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in 2016 when Hurricane Matthew pushed water across a protective marsh. Therewasnopropertydamage then, but the next year Hurricane Irma flooded several homes and damaged Clark's.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He knew about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  when he moved into the house 15 years ago, but it seemed like a distant threat. "It's definitely gone from, 'Oh, that's going to be my kids' or grandkids' problem,' to, 'Oh, this is going to be in my lifetime,'" he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Clark teamed up with Tech professor Kim Cobb, an oceanographer. Residents' instincts about ocean behavior are becoming less useful as the globe warms, Cobb said. Stronger storms are interacting with tides, rainfall, wind and topography in new and unexpected ways.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "This is a dynamic system, and when those communities lived through events like Matthew and Irma, they learned that lesson," Cobb said. "The storms that you could wait out before, you can't wait out this time."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The one government flood gauge for the entire coast produces limited data.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This led to a community meeting attended by Jenkins High engineering teacher Tom Maty. He volunteered his students to build ultrasonic water level sensors designed by Clark and his Tech colleagues.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I tried to sell it pretty well, and they kind of bought into it," Maty said of his students. Underclassmen soldered and assembled while seniors managed the process and tweaked the design, making the sensors more compact.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Tech also partnered with the city of Savannah and the Chatham Emergency Management Agency and plans to install about 60 of the sensors on bridges and docks. With half in place already, the emergency officials hope to use the live data to deploy equipment and personnel to the areas most likely to need help during the next hurricane. Emergency preparedness manager Randall Mathews said the data will, in the longer term, also be used to inform the public about evolving threats to neighborhoods once thought safe.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "There's a lot that people don't understand about hurricanes, and those are the kind of people who quickly become isolated and call for help when it's too late," he said.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Summer begins today, and along with the temperatures, debate over global warming is heating up.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Obama administration last week signaled a toughening stance on the issue with the issuance of its first report on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Drawing on previous research, the report places the White House firmly on the side of those who say global warming is an unfolding disaster requiring urgent action.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Democratic leadership in Congress has already set a goal of voting by summer's end on legislation that would cap greenhouse gas emissions and promote development of alternative energy sources.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Republicans contend that capping emissions will make no difference unless other nations do likewise, and would amount to a tax that would put the U.S. at an economic disadvantage. They call for other measures, such as accelerated construction of nuclear power plants.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told the Tulsa World that the report offered nothing new. The committee's chairwoman, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), said the report adds "urgency to the growing momentum in Congress" for passing a law.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Is the Obama administration on the right course? The Atlanta Journal-Constitution asked two Georgians with informed perspectives on the issue.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Yes Daniel M. Bodansky, Emily and Ernest Woodruff Chair in International Law, University of Georgia; former U.S. State Department 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  coordinator
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The report issued by the U.S. Global 
\f1\i\b \ul Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Research Program confirms that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal. Likely impacts include water shortages in the Southwest; inundation of coastal communities by storm surges and sea-level rise; more frequent heat waves; and threats to agriculture from heat, pests, and floods.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We can't stop 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  altogether. The carbon dioxide we've already emitted commits us to additional warming. But acting now to reduce emissions will avoid digging us into an even deeper hole. The legislation under consideration in Congress, while far from perfect, represents a sensible middle course, which would harness the power of the marketplace to reduce emissions cost-effectively. After eight years of foot-dragging by the Bush administration, it would reassert U.S. leadership on one of the critical issues of the 21st century. The United States cannot solve the problem by itself; China and other major emerging economies will need to limit their emissions as well. But to achieve an international agreement, U.S. leadership is essential.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 No Stan Wise member, Georgia Public Service Commission; past president, National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 President Obama's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  program would raise Georgia's utility rates by $8.6 billion over 10 years on the hope global temperatures would lower by a fraction of one degree over the next century. Europe instituted 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  taxes and the Kyoto Protocol, neither of which has reduced carbon emissions or fossil fuels.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Even Democrats are backing away from the 20 percent renewable mandate by 2020. Nuclear power, biomass or hydropower would not qualify. Consider this: A solar cell in the Southeast will run when it's not dark, hazy or raining, or about 15 percent of the hours in a year. Nuclear plants run an average of 90-plus percent of the hours in a year and produce zero emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Wealth would transfer from Southern and Midwest coal states to the two coasts and outside the country. Asian super-economies will not comply, but they will take our jobs as America is left at a competitive disadvantage.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Heat-related deaths are likely to soar over the next 40 years due to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  warming, but new research has found that increase could be cut by more than half --- and virtually eliminated in Atlanta --- if major cities across the nation embraced a greener footprint.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The four-year study out of Georgia Tech is the first major national assessment of city residents' health, the impact of rising temperatures and what local officials could do to alleviate a growing crisis.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Heat already kills more people in the United States than hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes combined, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And science shows most major cities, including Atlanta, are already warming at two times the rate of the planet.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 With the mercury likely to head higher in coming decades, the number of heat-related deaths in U.S. cities is projected to more than double by 2050, as the Tech report notes. A rise, too, is expected in heat-related illnesses including exhaustion and stroke, which can be fatal especially among vulnerable populations and can also add costs to the public health system.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Enter Tech planning professor Brian Stone Jr., whose research over the past few years has concentrated on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  warming and the concept of "urban heat islands" --- where a predominance of concrete and minimal amounts of vegetation exacerbate rising temperatures in cities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The next obvious step, Stone said, was to look at what cities could do to counteract those conditions, especially the effects related to health and heat. "We're moving into an era of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  adaption," said Stone, the director of Tech's Urban 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Lab. "But very few cities are studying how to manage rising temperatures."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It is an issue of interest for the CDC, which funded Stone's new study. "
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is very concerning from a public health standpoint," said Gino Marinucci, a strategy and policy adviser to the CDC's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and health program at the National Center for Environmental Health.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The CDC has begun working directly with local communities about how to combat the effects of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , an effort helped by Stone's work. "Awareness is increasing, but we still have a long way to go," Marinucci said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Using Atlanta, Philadelphia and Phoenix as his models, Stone found the projected increase in heat-related deaths would be cut by nearly 60 percent if cities adopted sustainability measures including planting more trees and adding green space, decreasing impervious surface areas such as parking lots, and using more reflective materials on roads and rooftops.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Better yet, in his backyard of Atlanta, he found these measures could effectively prevent any increase, not least because they have greater effect if done in increasing numbers. Atlanta, Stone said, includes such a large, sprawling metro region that suburbs taking similar action to modify heat's impact would have a bigger effect on the core city.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The findings, published online last month by the academic journal PLOS ONE, are likely to encourage local efforts. Suzanne Burnes, the executive director of the nonprofit Sustainable Atlanta, said her group's work, including Look Up Atlanta, can build on Stone's work, which she said could be applied to related sustainability issues such as water and air quality.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It's a positive step in seeing how these solutions are interrelated," Burnes said.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Two of the most urgent challenges facing the U.S. --- 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and our dependence on foreign oil --- intersect in Barack Obama's energy plan. The president-elect would invest billions of dollars to develop electric-powered cars, a move that would not only reduce tailpipe emissions but also would help the nation control its voracious appetite for gasoline. Obama also foresees massive investments in renewable energy sources: wind, solar, hydro, biomass, with two key objectives --- significantly reducing carbon emissions that contribute to global warming and creating millions of new "green collar" jobs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 1. CARS, PART 1. Obama promises to put 1 million plug-in hybrid electric cars on the road within six years. That's a lot of cars, but still less than 1 percent of the nation's registered passenger cars, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. These vehicles would get up to 150 mpg and, he says, would be made in America. General Motors, maker of the Volt, and Toyota, which is creating a plug-in version of its Prius hybrid, both intend to go into production soon, with the Volt coming out in 2010. GM says its car plugs into a standard home outlet and uses less electricity annually than a refrigerator. The Volt has a small gas-powered motor for when the batteries run dry. One problem may be price: GM is struggling to keep the rather cool-looking Volt under $40,000. Obama's answer is to offer a $7,000 tax credit to consumers who buy such vehicles. He also pledges that, one year into his term, he will have replaced all White House vehicles, "as security permits," with plug-in hybrids and that half of the cars the government buys will be all-electric or plug-in hybrids by 2012.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 2. CARS, PART 2. The government first set gas-mileage standards (known as CAFE, for Corporate Average Fuel Economy) in 1978 at 18 mpg for passenger cars. They rose to 27.5 mpg by 1990, and there they stayed until last year, when Congress passed an energy bill raising the CAFE standard to 35 mpg by 2020. Obama would accelerate that by raising CAFE 4 percent per year, putting the standard at about 32 mpg by the end of his first term. The president-elect has said he would "partner with domestic automakers" to help them retool from making big, low-mileage cars to making smaller, high-mileage cars. He has suggested $4 billion in loan guarantees to help Detroit convert its factories. That's not nearly enough, according to the automakers and the United Autoworkers, who went to Congress to plead for $25 billion for the same purpose. The prize, Obama says, is that within 10 years, the United States would save more oil than it currently imports from the Middle East or Venezuela.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 3. NEXT FOR NUCLEAR. The biggest threat to Atlanta-based Southern Co.'s nuclear ambitions to build two more reactors may be the economy and not the president-elect. Obama, after all, hails from Illinois, the nation's No. 1 nuclear power producer. He's said the energy source is a vital key to the nation's clean-energy future because it does not emit greenhouse gases. The more likely stopper is a tapped-out federal government, which may not be willing to hand out promised tax credits and loan guarantees to fast-track new nuclear plants. It's unlikely Southern can build two proposed reactors at Plant Vogtle on the Savannah River without the subsidies, which Obama voted for. As it stands, the company could net up to $125 million per year for eight years in tax credits to construct the reactors by 2021. But Obama has set a high bar for expansion. He says the nation must first find a safe, permanent place to store the nuclear waste, and it won't be Yucca Mountain. The Nevada site was originally scheduled to start accepting commercial nuclear waste in 1998. Going back to the drawing board will mean spending more years --- and money --- looking for an alternative.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 4. CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY. Coal is the dirtiest of the fossil fuels. It's also the nation's most abundant energy source and will continue to be a major source of electricity. Obama says he wants to figure out a way to burn it without emitting greenhouse gases. To that end, he plans to invest in research toward the industry's most elusive goal --- clean coal --- by helping the private sector build five viable coal-fired plants that capture carbon emissions and inject them into storage areas. So far, the technology is unproven. Southern Co. has worked for more than a decade without commercial success on a more modest effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal by turning the coal into a synthetic gas. If perfected, that technology would reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent to 25 percent over traditional plants with pollution controls.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 5. CAP AND TRADE. Obama told the San Francisco Chronicle in January that "electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket" under his economywide cap-and-trade system that would require power companies and other industries to pay for each ton of greenhouse gas emitted. Coal-fired power plants, which produce the majority of Georgia's electricity and emit the most carbon, would pay the most. Obama also said companies that try to build new coal-fired power plants "will be bankrupted" under his system. That's bad news for the energy companies and electric co-ops that want to build two more coal plants in Georgia. Under Obama's proposal, the federal government would sell companies pollution permits through an auction. Some of the money --- $15 billion a year --- would be spent on developing clean energy and energy efficiencies. The rest would be rebated directly to communities and families to soften the increased energy prices. Each year, greenhouse gases would be capped at lower levels, down to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Companies that cut their emissions the most could sell --- or trade --- the unused portion of their permit, creating a market for cleaner technologies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 6. THE DRIVE TO GREEN, PART 1. The centerpiece of Obama's energy plan is his investment of $150 billion over 10 years in the development of an energy future that is unlike anything we have seen. Obama would pour money into plug-in hybrid cars (see Cars 1, above), wind and solar and other renewable forms of energy, low-emission coal plants and biofuels. Obama's plan would require that the U.S. derive 10 percent of its energy from clean, renewable sources such as water, wind, solar and biomass by 2012. That goal jumps to 25 percent by 2025. Renewables accounted for 8.4 percent of total power generation in the U.S. in 2007, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Biomass and hydropower account for most of the renewable energy generated in the U.S. The fastest growth has been in wind, which has quadrupled in capacity in recent years, largely because the government offered a tax credit for renewable energy production. The tax credit, set to expire at the end of this year, has now been extended for an additional year, and Obama has pledged to renew it for five more years.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 7. THE DRIVE TO GREEN, PART 2. Obama's 10 percent renewables requirement will have less of an impact on states that have a "renewable portfolio standard" --- a program that mandates a certain level of power generation from renewable sources. Georgia is among the half of states that have not imposed a renewable portfolio standard. North Carolina, meanwhile, mandates that its major utilities derive at least 12.5 percent of the electricity sold by 2021 from renewable sources. Energy efficiency can help meet the target. Georgia Power opposes both state and federal mandates because they would force the company to use more expensive electricity sources that would in turn increase rates. Instead, the utility offers a green energy program in which customers may volunteer to pay an additional $3.50 or $4.50 a month to help the company produce electricity from renewable sources. The cheaper price is for landfill gases; the higher price is for solar power and a proposed wood-burning plant.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 8. DRILL, MAYBE, DRILL. Obama has grudgingly agreed to some oil drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf --- that giant area that lies three miles off the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts and extends, in some cases, for 200 miles. But he has insisted that oil companies drill where they already have leases before they seek new offshore leases from the Interior Department. Exit polling on Election Day showed that 50 percent of people voting for Obama also favored "drilling for oil offshore in U.S. waters were it is not currently allowed." Forty-five percent of Obama voters said they oppose it. President Bush this year ended the ban on offshore drilling that was imposed by his father nearly 20 years ago. Congress has imposed its own moratorium by inserting it into the Interior Department appropriations bill every year, The Washington Post reports. Congress has not passed an appropriations bill this year, so in theory, Interior is free to start granting offshore oil leases. It is unlikely, however, that congressional Democrats would permit that.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 9. $1,000 'EMERGENCY' TAX REBATES. Obama would hit up Big Oil for some big money, slapping on a windfall profits tax that he would use to fund "emergency energy rebates" to Americans. He proposes to issue checks of $500 per worker or $1,000 per household to help families keep up with high energy prices and rising food prices. "So the question is, does it make more sense for the oil companies to pay for it or does it make more sense for the struggling waitress who is barely getting by to pay for it?" he said to The Washington Post in August. "And the answer is, I'm going to fight for the waitress, not because I hate the oil companies but because I think it's more fair." Five days before Obama was elected, Exxon Mobil reported its highest quarterly profits ever: $14.8 billion. That was on the heels of its $11.7 billion net income in the second quarter --- also a record. ConocoPhillips reported a third-quarter profit of $5.1 billion, up 41 percent. But the price of oil has plummeted by more than half from its peak during the summer; gasoline prices, and probably oil company profits, are headed down.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 10. BIOFUELS. The University of Georgia and Georgia Tech stand to attract new federal dollars to continue research on the next generation of biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol made from pine trees, which are in abundant supply in Georgia. Obama's plan would also boost subsidies for biofuels. That's good news for First United Ethanol LLC (FUEL), which started operations at a corn-based ethanol plant last month in southwest Georgia, and two pine-based ethanol plants in development here. Obama also wants to mandate that the nation produce at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030, going beyond Congress' quota of 36 billion gallons by 2022. In 2007, the nation consumed 7.3 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel, or 4 percent of the total motor fuels consumed, according to the Energy Information Administration.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 WASHINGTON --- Following a furious thunderstorm on Sunday, the temperature here dropped more than 10 degrees, allowing residents of the capital city to go outdoors again. After several brutal days with the thermostat hovering near triple digits, temps in the mid- to high 80s felt downright balmy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 From what I've been reading about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , though, we'd better get used to miserable, scorching summers. We can stop using the term "heat wave" to describe what will become a routine pattern of high temperatures, overtaxed electricity grids and epidemics of heat strokes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 According to NASA, all but one of the 10 hottest years on record were since 1999. The agency expects this year to be the planet's hottest.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Still, the fierce heat wasn't enough to coax a vote on pricing carbon emissions through the Senate. While right-wingers like Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) used the blizzards that blanketed the city last winter to claim global warming is a hoax, Republicans just ignored the summer heat wave --- preferring to cast a price on carbon emissions as a job-killing "tax."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The legislation was abandoned by even Lindsay Graham and John McCain, who had once supported putting a price on carbon emissions. There were Democrats as well who had no enthusiasm for legislation that would force producers of dirty energy to pay for their carbon emissions. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), for example, wanted to protect his state's coal mines.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The "tax" argument had also surfaced in the House, although a cap-and-trade bill passed there last June, largely along party lines. Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) was still raging against the bill last month, claiming that it would boost electric rates to the detriment of the elderly.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "A lot of old people in Georgia and Florida and all out throughout the Southeast and the Southwest are dependent on air conditioning just to live. And if their electricity bills go sky high ... people are gonna die because of that," Broun, a physician, said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 So has the death of cap-and-trade relieved Broun of his worry about the elderly and hypothermia? It shouldn't. According to The Washington Post, high temperatures claim more lives in the United States than tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and lightning combined --- about 700 a year.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Unlike Inhofe and Broun, thinking conservatives don't dismiss 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  as junk science or a liberal conspiracy. Instead, many of them prefer to cast a preferred solution --- pricing carbon emissions --- as worse than the 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  wrought by global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some of them even contend that a warmer Earth will produce an agricultural bounty that will result in increased global prosperity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Pentagon doesn't think so. The nation's military leaders now list 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  as a national security threat. The CNA Corp., a Pentagon-funded think tank, warned in 2007 that global warming will spark wars over water, crop failures and massive movements of refugees across borders.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The industrial West may suffer those forces only indirectly, but less pleasant summers won't be the only consequence for Americans. Climatologists predict more severe weather --- more powerful and more dangerous hurricanes, more severe rainstorms, and both floods and more droughts.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Fiscal conservatives have tended to cast the battle against government debt as a crusade to save their children and grandchildren from crushing taxes. They're right to worry about rising red ink.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But we ought to worry at least as much about a warming planet's effects on the lives of children and grandchildren. The consequences could be much more severe than higher taxes.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 We face societal and economic 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  at every level in the United States. Giants of heavy industry, retail trade, communications and the service sectors are streamlining, retooling and reinventing themselves. The sharply reduced circumstances in which we find ourselves are so dramatic as to justify the label of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , as opposed to a passing storm.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Historically, watershed moments such as this have pushed universities to restructure everything from basic research to how and where our undergraduates live. This time, rather than being reactive, we should pause to ask careful questions about how best to move toward a transformation of our own choosing.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The GI Bill, one such watershed opportunity for universities, was passed when the return of American soldiers from World War II threatened to boost unemployment and plunge the economy back into depression. It helped to stimulate an era of growth on American campuses, providing the fuel for the economic expansion of the 1950s through training engineers, scientists and business leaders.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The postwar years also witnessed the acceleration of federal commitment to research through the collaborative efforts of the government, private industry and research scientists. There is no doubt that our collective response has had long-term benefit to the nation. Yet our response was also reactive and, without our anticipating it, fundamentally altered the mission of higher education.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For instance, it was not until 15 years after the National Science Foundation was created that the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities were launched in 1965. Even then, the latter had nowhere near the resources of their science and health counterparts --- leading to a perception that the arts and humanities intrinsically had less value. This distortion took root in our universities. The question remains whether it reflects the values of society at large or, conversely, whether it might have contributed to our current state of affairs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This time, our investment should include commitments that will return us to the transporting promise of the liberal arts --- freeing all of us, teachers and learners alike, from the limitations of our self-centered perspectives; enabling us to understand the world from others' viewpoints; and empowering us to be agents of societal 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . We must affirm that education is as much about insight as it is about gaining information or job training; it is about the duty to listen as well as the responsibility to speak out, about the pursuit of wisdom as well as knowledge. We should understand that the study and practice of ethics must find a home in our graduate schools of business and medicine just as it does in our liberal arts colleges.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 If not on a college campus, where else in modern society can such emotionally fraught and self-critical examinations take place? It seems to me this is the indispensable duty of our universities and one that must flourish if our free and open society is to survive.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 American universities should resist the notion that the economic 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  today leaves us unable to influence our own destiny. We should become institutions that engage in what our community's vision statement at Emory has dubbed "courageous inquiry." In a global economy where one country's collapse endangers others; in a global incubator where an animal virus can mutate to humans and prompt fear of a pandemic; in a global ecology where delayed responses to 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  harbor the potential for planetary disaster; and on an international stage where nuclear warfare remains a threat, universities must offer a venue for robust, fearless debate and scholarship. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This is the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  we need, in a time of crisis we cannot afford to waste.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The libertarian CATO Institute sent out a blast email a while back seeking scientists willing to sign their names to a petition disputing President Obama's claim of a scientific consensus on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . They got 116 to respond, and CATO has now published that petition in major national newspapers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Interestingly, 25 of those who signed the petition describe themselves as either retired or professor emeritus. And through the magic of Google, you find that many of those on the Cato petition work in disciplines rather far afield from atmospheric science and climatology.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 There's Susan Crockford. She's a "an archeoanthropologist who specializes in the evolutionary theory of the domestic dog." Craig Idso is a geographer by training. Peter Salonius is a soil microbiologist. Neil Hutton is a retired petroleum geologist. Ross McKitrick is an economist by training who works at a right-wing "think tank" in Canada. Bob Breck is a New Orleans TV weatherman. David Kean of New Zealand is a retired geologist. John Reinhard is director of clinical services at Ore Pharmaceuticals.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Now, think of the thousands, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands or even millions of people around the world who could be described as "scientists" by the definition apparently applied by Cato. Out of that population, Cato was able to find 116 to dispute claims of a scientific consensus on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and the importance of taking action.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 You have to ask: Is that really the best Cato could do? And if it is, why would Cato broadcast its glaring lack of success to the world at large?

\f3\fs20 \cf0 On Sept. 2, as Hurricane Dorian battered the Bahamas, Georgia meteorologist Marshall Shepherd tweeted his reaction: "Simply unbelievable...The Bahamas are enduring something I just can't fathom...," he wrote. Shepherd, director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia, circled a line of text in the advisory from the National Weather Service National Hurricane Center: "Present movement: Stationary."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Category 5 hurricane was traveling at 1.3 mph, the slowest speed ever recorded for a major hurricane. At times, it stopped moving entirely, unleashing its fury on the islands of Great Abaco and Grand Bahama for 48 hours.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 With the Bahamas now in recovery mode and facing a death toll of at least 50, Dorian is officially a record-breaking storm, and it may be indicative of what future hurricanes might look like.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While we are moving into a period where fewer hurricanes are approaching the coast, those that do are in the range of Category 3 to Category 5, according to a 2017 study by James Kossin, an atmospheric researcher at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Center for Weather and 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Between 1924 and 2019, there have been 35 Category 5 hurricanes in the North Atlantic, five of which have occurred in the past four hurricane seasons -- a rate scientists consider well beyond average.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The scientific studies and literature don't say we are going to see more frequent or more hurricanes, but when we do get them, they are likely to be more intense given the increase in warmth of the ocean near and just beneath the surface," said Shepherd.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Starting with Matthew in 2016, this is the fourth hurricane season -- the period from June to November -- that a Category 5 storm has ripped through the Atlantic basin. With maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, Dorian was the strongest of them all.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Scientists are still trying to understand if human activities -- particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming--have a detectable impact on hurricane activity.Some caution against overstating the link.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In a Sept. 10 op-ed in the National Review, Judith Curry, president of 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Forecast Applications Network and a professor emerita of earth and atmospheric sciences at Georgia Tech, writes that links between 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in hurricane activity and human-caused global warming cannot be made with much confidence. "There is a small overall trend of increasing hurricane intensity, but we only have global data back to 1970 and you can't tell from that if it is natural variability or man-made global warming," said Curry by phone.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But research from leading climatologists has linked some characteristics seen in Dorian -- slow movement, storm intensity and higher storm surges -- to impacts of global warming rather than natural causes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last year, Kossin found that hurricanes moving over land in the North Atlantic have slowed by as muchas20%.He attributes that slower motion in part to the effects of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  amplified by human activity. Hurricanes are propelled from place to place by steering winds, but as the Earth's atmosphere warms, those winds can weaken, slowing down or totally stalling the storms.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The impact of global warming on 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the patterns of the jet stream, the big current of air that brings a lot of our weather, is still a developing area of research, but scientists said the pattern of hurricanes parking themselves in place, like Dorian in the Bahamas, Florence in the Carolinas (2018) and Harvey in Texas (2017), is growing.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Hurricanes are also getting wetter, said scientists. The Earth's warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, allowing hurricanes to have more water in them than they used to, said Kristina Dahl, senior 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists. More water in hurricanes combined with stalled movement can lead to the kind of record-breaking rainfall and massive flooding that devastates entire cities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 All of that warm, moist air and warm water in the ocean acts as fuel for hurricanes, making them stronger.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Dorian had plenty of energy to tap into. When it passed off the coast of Florida, the temperature of the ocean's surface was about 0.5 to 1 degree above normal, Dahl said. A 1-degree Fahrenheit rise in ocean temperature can increase the wind speed of a hurricane by 15-20 mph, she said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At one point, Dorian's winds jumped from an already intense 150 mph up to its maximum speed of 185 mph.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 When hurricanes make landfall, storm surge -- the water pushed onto shore by hurricane winds -- can overwhelm coastal areas. Dorian's storm surge in the Bahamas reached almost 24 feet, leaving the airport in Freeport engulfed in water. Residents on the Georgia coast were spared, but they know too well the perils of rising sea levels. Add a hurricane to already rising waters, and the potential for devastation is even greater.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Sea levels have risen as big ice sheets in Greenland and the Western Arctic have melted from the effects of global warming and sent freshwater into the ocean, Shepherd said. As ocean water has become warmer from 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , the increase in temperature has caused the water to expand and rise even more. Add to that parts of the coastline that are disappearing due to natural sinking of the land, and conditions are set for flooding long before a hurricane comes near.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "You have these issues, then you add a hurricane with storm surge and it's exacerbating the situation," Shepherd said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Shepherd said scientists have struggled to convey to the public concerns about the impacts of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  on our weather system. He allows that the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  has 
\f1\i\b \ul changed
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  naturally, but because of human-induced 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , those natural occurrences are being amplified, he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A developing field of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  science known as 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  attribution is helping scientists to better identify and quantify the role of human-caused 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in different types of extreme weather.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Skeptics will say 'We aren't getting too many hurricanes this year' but did you see the typhoons that pummeled the Philippines? Those are the same types of storms as hurricanes," Shepherd said. "The key message going forward is they are just going to accelerate. It is not going to be an incremental 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Memo to environmental activists: It's the oceans, stupids.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This summer, people will flock to beaches to swim, surf, wade, boat, fish, sunbathe, or even fall in love. To these revelers, the oceans are eternal -- a permanent bounty in an impermanent world.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But there is a rub: The oceans are living entities and they are in trouble.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Mark Spalding, president of The Ocean Foundation, says, "We are putting too much into the oceans and taking too much out."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Whether deliberately or not, we are dumping stuff into the oceans at a horrifying rate and, in places, we are overfishing them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But the No. 1 enemy of oceans is invisible: carbon.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Carbon is a huge threat, according to ocean champion U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. The oceans are a great carbon sink, he explains, but they are reaching a carbon saturation point, and as so-called "deep carbon" resurfaces, it limits the oxygen in the water and destroys fish and marine life.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 There is a 6,474-squaremile "dead zone" -- an area about the size of Connecticut with low to no oxygen -- in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Dead zones are appearing in oceans around the world due to excessive nutrient pollution (especially nitrogen and phosphorous) from agribusiness and sewage. Two great U.S. estuaries are in trouble: the Chesapeake Bay and the Long Island Sound.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Warming in the North Atlantic is disturbing fish populations: Maine lobsters are migrating to Canada's cooler waters.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The shallow seas, like the Baltic and the Adriatic, are subject to "red tides" -- harmful algal booms, due to nutrient overenrichment, that kill fish and make shellfish dangerous to consume.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Polluted waterways are a concern for Rio de Janiero Olympic rowers and other athletes. Apparently, the word is: Don't follow the girl from Ipanema into the water. The culprit is raw sewage, and the swelling Olympic crowds will only worsen the situation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 My appeal to the environmental community is this: If you are worried about the air, concentrate on the oceans. It is hard to explain greenhouse gases to a public that is distrustful, or fears the economic effect of reducing fossil fuel consumption. If I lived in a West Virginia hollow, and the only work was coal mining, you bet I would be a 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  denier.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The oceans are easier to understand. You can explain that the sea levels are rising; that it is possible for life-sustaining currents, like the Gulf Stream, to stop or reverse course; and you can point to the ways seemingly innocent actions, or those thought of as virtuous (like hefting around spring water in plastic bottles) have harmful effects.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Plastic is a big problem. Great gyres of plastic, hundreds of miles long, are floating in the Pacific. Flip-flops washed into the ocean in Asia are piling up on beaches in Africa. Fish are ingesting microplastic particles -- and you will ingest this plastic when you tuck into your fish and chips. Sea birds and dolphins get tangled in the plastic harnesses we put on six-packs of beer and soft drinks. They die horrible deaths. Sunscreen is lethal to coral.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Not only is the faith community not active enough in addressing environmental issues, in many cases people of faith have actively resisted the notion that we are facing real and even life-threatening environmental issues. If you take just one issue, I have frequently heard good people say, "I just don't believe in global warming." That's a little like saying "I just don't believe the earth is round." Whether we believe in it or not, scientific facts are now demonstrating that global warming is real, and that human beings (particularly through overconsumption and waste) have contributed to it. Another mistake faith communities have made is thinking this is a political issue rather than the issue of environmental stewardship that it is. Human beings were given dominion over the earth because God thought we were smart enough to use our world's resources wisely and well. Yet the serious global environmental issues we are facing reflect not wisdom, but greed and pride. As for everyone doing their (even small) part, we have to start somewhere. But at the same time we also need a bigger movement, backed by funding from corporations and government, and talked about and worked on in every community (workplace, church, and neighborhood) to make real 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in lifestyle that can reverse the direction we are heading.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 ---The Rev. Kathy McDowell, Peachtree Corners Christian Church pastor
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It isn't the church's responsibility to address environmental issues. As individual Christians we are to be good and faithful caretakers of all that God has given us (that includes the earth). But we do not need to be overly concerned about the "dire" nature of these environmental issues because God has promised, "While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, winter and summer, and day and night shall not cease" (Genesis 8:22).
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Too many churches today are neglecting the preaching of Christ crucified in favor of participation in ever-increasing social and political causes. The recent partnership between Ted Turner with the ELCA, LC-MS, and UMC to fight malaria in Africa is a perfect example. Fighting malaria and addressing environmental issues are certainly noble causes, but the church isn't fulfilling its calling now! True Christian teaching is being watered down, and we are failing to carry out Christ's command to teach "them to observe all things that I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:20). The result of not teaching the whole counsel of God faithfully is this: "The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth" (2 Timothy 4:3-4). This is readily apparent within many churches right now! The church needs to return to its God-given directive of preaching the message of Christ crucified and all things He has commanded.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 ---The Rev. Nathanael Mayhew, Zion Lutheran Church pastor
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The clergy community has an obligation to point people in the right direction and to underscore the gift of God's earth, as reflected in Psalm 136: "Give thanks unto the Lord for He is good. His mercy and His love are always with us. The harmony of nature reveals God's wisdom ..." We as ministers, priests and rabbis continue to remind and instruct our congregants through the ancient wisdom of the Bible. People who hear the message must then turn the message into action. Each individual must ask, "What have I done to reduce pollution, to recycle, or to promote the harmony of nature, to maintain our beloved earth?"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 ---Rabbi Ronald Bluming, Temple Beth David
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Bible teaches us that the Church's primary focus must be the preaching of the Word (2 Timothy 4:2). As we consider the life and ministry of Jesus it quickly becomes clear that He never deviated from His mission but kept the main thing the main thing. The Church is here to save men, not save the planet, to warn others about the fires of hell, not global warming and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , and that Jesus died on the cross to cleanse us from the pollution of sin, not CO2 emissions. As we consider the worth of a human soul in contrast with importance of these current "hot" political topics, a verse comes to mind in Mark 8:36, "For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 ---Pastor Mark Byrd, Calvary Chapel
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I think we have a pretty spotty record on this one. God gave us the earth and expects us to be a good steward of all he has entrusted to us. We can see all around us the evidence of our sins of commission and omission in caring for God's creation. As pastors we have often failed to call for repentance and restoration in this and other areas. I don't think the issue is so much liberal vs. conservative or exploiters vs. tree huggers. I think the issue relates more to personal awareness of impact and responsibility. There are so many things we can do which will aggregate into big 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . We are indeed called to be good stewards of all that God has entrusted to us. We need to do a better job as faith communities of sharing this as part of God's word.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 ---The Rev. Keith Lawder, Simpsonwood United Methodist Church associate pastor
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I believe it was Dr. Jacob Bronowski in the PBS documentary "The Ascent of Man" who said that human beings were not, like other animals, creatures who live in the landscape, but are in fact creators of the landscape. As such, we have special responsibilities as stewards of Creation. The Book of Genesis in the Bible is clear on this point: Our dominion over Creation, such as it is, comes with awesome responsibilities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But nature is very subtle, and it is hard to know just what exactly to do. One example:
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In the late thirties a Swiss chemist named Paul Muller discovered the insecticide properties of DDT. DDT is extremely effective in destroying the insect-borne diseases of typhus and malaria. Unfortunately, it is a poison that tends to stay in animal fatty tissue.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Forty six years ago Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" pointed out the dangers of DDT so effectively that the pesticide was widely banned by developed countries. Many environmentalists wanted to ban it in tropical countries, too. But the mosquitoes that DDT kills so effectively carry the malaria which could take millions of lives if the insecticide is abruptly discontinued. So only very careful thinking, not simplistic solutions driven by political ideology, is called for to solve this and other environmental problems.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 ---Rabbi Richard Baroff, Guardians of the Torah
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Any understanding of God's will for our lives must take caring for creation into account. The first "calling" found in Scripture includes God's charge for us to be good stewards of His creation. Why? Creation sustains life, has a way of putting us in our place and is the greatest witness to a Creator. Living in our urban jungles, it can be easy to forget the serious responsibility of God's call for us to be good stewards of creation. As stewards, we must do better in our advocacy of environmental issues and our participation in environment-saving practices. If we don't do better, future generations will suffer because we failed "on our watch." If we don't do better, the greatest witness to God will no longer testify. If we don't do better, we run the risk of forgetting that we are the created, not the Creator. The better we do, the better chance there is of a world abounding with Psalm 8 moments, and what a world that would be. "When I consider your heavens, the works of your hands, the moon and the stars which you have set in place, who are mere mortals that you are mindful of us, human beings that you care for us? ... Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 ---The Rev. Drew Gaylor, Gwinnett Church of Christ minister
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 There is a great quote attributed to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It's something like: the church has the option of being the thermostat of the world or the thermometer, meaning we, the church, can be the source of 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  or, as a thermometer, simply record ideas and principles that arise out of popular opinion.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We have missed the opportunity to be the "thermostat" on environmental issues, often dubbing such groundbreaking issues as too radical for the church. But we are beginning to act as a thermometer, measuring and judging those environmental movements already at work.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I do not believe that we are active enough in addressing environmental issues, though, as a vehicle is judged Christian not according to its emissions or gas consumption, but according to the presence or absence of a fish symbol. We are concerned with creation, but too often only as a theological issue to be dealt with by a war on Darwinism. We forget that regardless of how God created our world, we are left with responsibility over it --- a responsibility that we have dealt with selfishly, without regard for fellow human beings. God offers guidance leading us to live responsibly on this earth God created today. While I wish the church had spoken up earlier, I am grateful that we are beginning to speak up now.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 ---The Rev. Joe Evans, Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church associate pastor
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Probably not. We can get pretty lazy on that stuff. However, the church has a vested interest in environmentalism more than any other organization because followers of Jesus believe that Jesus came to redeem all of creation. We believe God called creation "good." We probably don't stress that enough. When we do, though, it needs to be geniune. It's sort of sad to see "being green" as trendy right now, and I wonder how much of it is slick marketing rather than genuine concern for the environment. So when faith communities do step forward on the environmental issues, it needs to be centered on authentic concern for all of God's creation. People that love God should love earth more than anyone else on the planet. That just makes sense.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 --- The Rev. Carter McInnis, Church of the Way lead pastor
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 No, I think that all faith communities have tremendous potential to help coach us to steward well God's beautiful creation. We seem to spend more time teaching stewardship of finances and physical health than we do teaching the stewardship of the world we are blessed to live in. My prayer is that God would give us a Holy Passion to be better stewards of water, air, land and wildlife and respect each as a part of God's creation to sustain human life.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 WASSAW SOUND ESTUARY, GA.--The fall of 2013 should have been a blessing for Georgia shrimpers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A bacterial infection had wiped out the Asian shrimp farms that drove many Americans out of business. Early sampling at the time indicated a bumper crop of white shrimp on the way. Many poured money into fixing up their boats in preparation for long, rewarding days on the water.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But the nets came up empty.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "They were gone," recalled Marc Frischer, a microbiologist at the University of Georgia's Skidaway Institute of Oceanography near Savannah. "There were no shrimp."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Wildlife officials and shrimpers clashed over the cause of the sudden die-off. What followed was years of research by a team of scientists across the South.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The results of those efforts show how 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  are likely impacting Georgia's coastal ecosystems, and those who depend on them to make a living.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I'm 100% a believer," said Richard Puterbaugh, president of the Georgia Shrimp Association. "I had a front-row seat for 45 years. I've seen the 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Shrimping has, historically, been vital to the food, culture and economy of the Georgia coast. Today, it makes up a tiny fraction of state's gross domestic product. Still, this shrinking industry supports hundreds of jobs and brings in millions of dollars.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As shrimpers follow their crop north into colder waters, and a new shrimp parasite reaches epidemic proportions, scientists are investigating how 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  could influence the future of shrimp and shrimping in the Southeast.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Temperature, current, rain flow -- all of those are related to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , and all of those play very critical roles in the complicated biology and ecology of the system," said Frischer. "Not just for shrimp, for everything."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 After the shrimp disappeared in 2013, the government declared a fishery disaster.Officials cited extreme rainfall that likely prevented shrimp larvae, hatched offshore in the ocean, from returning to the estuaries where they grow to maturity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But shrimpers were unconvinced. They blamed black gill, a mysterious affliction that was becoming increasingly prevalent in shrimp harvested off the Georgia coast. Named for the immune response that darkens the crustacean's gills, black gill is harmless to humans who eat the shrimp and does not affect taste. But it weakens the animal, making it more vulnerable to predators and less likely to survive.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A reporter for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently joined Frischer and his colleagues aboard the Research Vessel Savannah to study black gill in the Wassaw Sound Estuary. The intention of the annual stakeholder cruise is to bring together shrimpers, academics and wildlife officials to share research and observations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Black gill remains a source of tension--particularly between shrimpers, who say it is devastating their crop, and wildlife managers, who say they have no evidence of that.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Mike Younce of Brunswick was a commercial shrimper for two decades. He said he first started noticing black gill, and its effect on shrimp, in the late '90s.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The shrimp that didn't have the black gill, they would be lively," Younce said. "They would be jumping when they hit the deck."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The shrimp with darkened gills, however, were small and sickly, their shells soft.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "They were out of gumption," said Younce. "Like they were wore out."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Solving the
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 mystery of black gill
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Scientists knew black gill was caused by an immune response in the shrimp's body, but to what? Where did it come from, and why was it spreading?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Frustration over the failed 2013 harvest pushed the Georgia Sea Grant, part of a federal program based at colleges and universities, to prioritize funding for black gill research.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Since then, scientists have established that the black gill seen in Georgia shrimp is caused by a ciliate -- a single-celled organism that attaches itself to the animal's gills. Ciliates are fairly common hitchhikers on shrimp, but they had never been known to cause problems.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "There aren't actually that many experts in the world that work on ciliate parasites of crustaceans," Frischer said. "We showed (our research) to all of them, around the world, and nobody had seen anything like that before."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It took years of collecting, dissecting and studying shrimp, but, in 2019, scientists were finally able to put a name to the scourge: A brand new species of ciliate they called Hyalophysa lynni after a well-known marine biologist, Denis Lynn, who died in 2018.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Much work remains to be done in order to determine how, exactly, the parasite feeds and spreads. In the meantime, it has reached epidemic proportions off the coast of Georgia and South Carolina, and appears to be moving into the Gulf of Mexico and as far north as the Chesapeake Bay.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Stephen Landers, the protozoologist at Troy University in Alabama who identified Hyalophysa lynni, said the species "broke the mold" of how this type of ciliate was expected to behave.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Parasite species don't just evolve in 50 years," Landers said. "This is something that's been on the planet for millions of years. Now, at this time, in this part of the world, for whatever reason, it's thriving."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Experts say there appears to be a strong correlation between black gill and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  conditions. While correlation does not equal causation, this theory is supported by experiments in the lab on the shrimp themselves.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In one study, 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  water temperature by just two degrees had a huge impact on mortality rates for shrimp exposed to the parasite: a difference of up to 70%.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Coastal water temperatures in Georgia have increased by nearly five degrees over the past four decades, according to data collected by the state. Even with seasonal variation, the increasing trend is clear. Using a commonly employed statistical test developed by U.S. government scientists, the AJC concluded that such a consistent and steady increase is unlikely to arise randomly.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Most infectious disease in aquatic animals is worse with rising temperatures," said Eddie Leonard, a marine biologist with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. "I don't think it's unlikely that there is some relationship between global temperature and infection rates, including for black gill."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Warming waters, warming planet
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In order to understand what's happening to Georgia's coast, it's important to understand why global temperatures are -- on average -- rising.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Earth's atmosphere is so thin, compared to the planet's size, that it has been compared to the parchment skin of an onion. Most of the ultrathin layer that supports life is made up of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (20.9%) and argon (0.9%).
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Less than 0.05% of the atmosphere is made up of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane. These gases absorb and then reemit heat from the sun to keep the planet at a livable temperature. Because these gases make up such a small proportion of the atmosphere but play such a large role in regulating Earth's surface temperature, human activity like burning fossil fuels can and does have a global impact.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Before the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels were about 280 parts per million. Today, they have surpassed 400 ppm -- the highest in at least 800,000 years.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And just as a two-degree temperature shift can mean life or death for a shrimp, 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  to global temperature that appear slight can have far-reaching consequences.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Earlier this year, scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies announced global temperatures in 2018 were 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the "baseline" period of 1951 to 1980. The past five years are, collectively, the warmest in the modern record, they said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "2018 is yet again an extremely warm year on top of a long-term global warming trend," GISS Director Gavin Schmidt said in a statement at the time. "The impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt -- in coastal flooding, heat waves, intense precipitation and ecosystem 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Most excess heat and greenhouse gases are absorbed by the world's oceans, which are growing warmer and more acidic as a result. Ice sheets are melting, and sea levels are rising. Major currents, like the Gulf Stream, which brings warm water up from the tropics past Georgia on its way to the North Atlantic, are slowing and possibly shifting course.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 These and other 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  are affecting 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and weather systems around the globe. On Georgia's coast, that includes 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in water temperature, salinity and oxygen levels in the estuaries that are home to countless species, including shrimp.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "For me, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is not about polar bears or the year 2080 -- it is about issues affecting the daily lives of all of us right now," said Marshall Shepherd, director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at UGA. "This is one of them. We eat shrimp, and hardworking people rely on them for their livelihood."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Disappearing way of life
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia's shoreline once teemed with shrimp boats, mostly small, family-owned wooden trawlers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It looked like a city out there," said Puterbaugh of the Georgia Shrimp Association. "Now, if you see 10 boats it's crowded. That's how much it's 
\f1\i\b \ul changed
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In 1979, there were 1,471 licensed shrimp boats. Last year, the state issued permits to just 258. Some of the same families remain in the business, but most of the small crafts have been replaced by larger, more expensive boats, and about a third of licenses were given to non-Georgia residents.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The decline of the local shrimp industry is largely due to economic factors. The cost of maintaining and fueling a boat is high, and dock prices for wild caught shrimp are comparatively low. Consumers have grown accustomed to paying bargain prices for cheap farmed shrimp, mostly imported from Asia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But some say the shrimp crop has also become more unreliable because of black gill.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "This is not a minor problem," said Mike Sullivan, who has been shrimping off the Georgia coast for 52 years, since he was 14. "This problem is killing millions of pounds of harvestable shrimp."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia wildlife officials are cautious in their assessment of black gill's impact on the industry.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I don't think it's good, but I'm not terribly concerned it's going to collapse the fishery," said Leonard, the DNR biologist.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some of the shrimpers who spoke to The AJC were wary of the proposed connection between 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and black gill in Georgia. They speculated the prevalence of the parasite could be caused by chemical runoff, contamination from farmed shrimp or 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  to the ecology of the sounds since they were barred from trawling there in the late '70s.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But they also say they have seen 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  that seem to fit a broader pattern.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I've noticed, over the past 10 years, that it seems like the best shrimp production is occurring further and further north," said Bill Harris, who owns two 75-foot trawlers and manages a dock in Townsend. "Our falls have been faltering and the black gill settling in, while further north that traditionally had no white shrimp season at all are just logging these phenomenal landings."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Pat Mathews, a third-generation shrimper, said when he first started seeing black gill, it would only appear in white shrimp in late summer. Then it began showing up in brown shrimp in June. This year, he found it in roe shrimp as early as May.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It definitely flourishes when the water temperature peaks," said Mathews. "If this black gill goes away, we're liable to all be doing good. Back like it used to be."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But to Frischer, the microbiologist, black gill is more likely a harbinger of things to come.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It's a canary in the coal mine, and it's not the first," he said. "There are many emerging diseases, all over the planet, in both marine and terrestrial organisms, that are clearly being affected by 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Atlanta isn't home to any icebergs at risk of melting. It's not on the coast, where rising sea levels can flood communities. And while summers in the city are hot, Atlanta is far from becoming a dry desertscape.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But the impacts of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  are likely to still put long-term stress on metro Atlanta, scientists, officials and activists said, one day after The New York Times published a report that predicts rising temperatures nationwide and reduced rainfall in the southeastern United States.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The study, which had not been made public but was obtained by the Times, was conducted by researchers from 13 federal agencies and concluded that the average U.S. temperature is expected to rise. In the southeast, the report predicts, conditions are getting drier.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We look at the science; we are aware of the trends that only seem to be worsening when it comes to the impacts of a warming 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," Stephanie Stuckey, the chief resilience officer for the City of Atlanta, said. "We're very aware of the drought and the increasing temperatures."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 An overwhelming majority of scientists agree that the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , and that humans are primarily responsible for global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Even land-locked cities like Atlanta, Stuckey said, will witness the effects of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , specifically a water supply that could decrease over the next several years. At the same time, the city is also likely to face population growth as an indirect result of sea level rise, which can force coastal residents to move inward, she said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The report published Monday night "rings true to what we've seen in previous reports," said Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist and the director of the Atmospheric Sciences program at the University of Georgia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Different parts of the state are vulnerable to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in different ways, Shepherd said. Urban areas are more likely to see extreme heat and intense bursts of urban flooding, while southern parts of the state are more susceptible to drought, he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Within the metro area, Stuckey's team is preparing a 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  action strategy, which includes longterm solutions for increasing energy and water efficiency. The city hopes to build a water reservoir, install solar panels on public buildings and partner with the private sector to increase sustainability.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 One area already seeing the impacts of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is the Chattahoochee River, which creeps across almost the entire state and provides water to about 4 million people.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is a real threat to river flow, and to rainfall, and to heat -- all factors that affect the river system," said Juliet Cohen, the executive director for Chattahoochee Riverkeeper. "That 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  will affect many aspects of the human and environmental experience. We know that they are occurring, scientists have documented them."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Less rainfall, which the recent federal report anticipates, would "aggravate an already contentious relationship between the various users of the river system," Cohen said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rising temperatures can impact fish and wildlife, and flooding damages infrastructure, she said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgians have turned a closer eye to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in recent years, research suggests. Almost 70 percent of residents believe global warming is happening, and 55 percent said they are worried about global warming, according to a 2016 study by the Yale Program on 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Communication.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This weekend, outspoken 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  activist Al Gore is scheduled speak at the progressive Netroots Nation conference in downtown Atlanta. And next month, Chattahoochee Riverkeeper is hosting their first-ever conference on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is one of the sponsors of that conference.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The report published by the Times raised eyebrows because the scientists' conclusions contradict statements made by President Trump and members of his administration, the newspaper noted. Trump announced in June that he will pull the U.S. out of the 2015 Paris 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Agreement, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has said he does not believe carbon dioxide emissions are a primary driver of global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Actions by the federal government, however, have little impact on what Atlanta officials do to fight 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , Stuckey said. "I tend to focus on where I can actually have impact and where we have direct control," she said. "Our energies are directly spent on (asking), where can we as cities be really forward-thinking and innovative?" Mayor Kasim Reed, in conjunction with many mayors across the country, pledged to still uphold the city's commitment to the Paris accords. "All the cities jointly," Stuckey said, "are so much more powerful than a federal entity, because it's a global network."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 In 2016, Cindy Lowrey very reluctantly cast her ballot for Donald Trump.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Columbus resident couldn't identify with Hillary Clinton and decided to listen to her husband and friends who said the Republican would be better for the economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Four years later, Lowrey regrets that vote but finds her current options less than optimal. And Tuesday's presidential debate offered little by way of clarity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I lasted 53 minutes," said Lowrey, 60, a retired postmaster. It "did nothing more than turn me off of the entire process."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 With recent polls showing the presidential race too close to call in Georgia, Lowrey is part of a narrowing pool of undecided or persuadable voters-- particularly suburban women -- whom the Trump and Joe Biden campaigns are fighting over with less than five weeks until Election Day.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Trump has emphasized his economic platform and warned of suburban crime to try winning them over, while nominating a solidly conservative female jurist to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme Court. Biden has homed in on health care, Trump's temperament and the president's handling of the coronavirus.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Polling shows the increasingly small slice of the electorate over which they're fighting.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution survey of 1,150 likely voters found that only 4% of Georgians are undecided. A pre-debate Quinnipiac University poll suggested the playing field may be even narrower:Some 97% of Georgians have made up their minds, and only 2% are open to being persuaded.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "No matter what information comes out or what happens I doubt that many people are going to be moved one way or the other, except for this very small percentage of potentially persuadable voters that are undecided," said Trey Hood, a University of Georgia political scientist who conducted the AJC poll.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Those undecided voters, he said, "could affect the outcome of the election" in Georgia if they break toward one candidate over the other.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In recent interviews with the AJC, several undecided or persuadable voters indicated they're weighing issues as wide-ranging as health care, foreign policy, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and even the Postal Service. Some, such as Lowrey, are moderates who loathe the incendiary rhetoric that has defined the presidential contest and this week's debate. Others think the two main parties don't represent their views and are struggling with whether to hold their noses and support Biden or Trump -- or vote for someone else entirely.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Consider Bavard Rahdar part of the latter category.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The 32-year-old Sandy Springs resident was an enthusiastic Bernie Sanders supporter but became disillusioned with the way the Democratic Party treated the Vermont senator in 2016.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I don't think either party truly has the interests of the American people at heart," said Rahdar, who works in information technology and counts universal health care, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and police reform among his top issues.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rahdar is leaning toward casting his ballot for the Green Party or a write-in candidate, but he said Biden could still win his vote if he makes an "amazing grand gesture that really shows good faith."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The possibility of that happening, he acknowledged, is small. Tuesday's debate performance did nothing to convince him.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "If Biden can't promise progressive 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  as a part of his platform, then at least for myself I can't vote for him in good conscience," Rahdar said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Brenda Sevcik, meanwhile, has spent months agonizing over her decision.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Milton mother of three has always identified as a Republican but prefers a divided government in which Democrats and the GOP check one another and compromise in the middle. That position puts her at odds with her husband, a fervent Trump supporter, and her left-leaning
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 20-something daughter.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "What makes me sad is I have people I love who are very angry at me for not exactly believing what they do, on both sides of the aisle," said Sevcik, 56. "I have been told that being a moderate is a dangerous animal, and I need to pick a side."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Sevcik was undecided in the 2016 presidential race until she entered the voting booth.A devout Catholic, she ultimately backed Trump to ward off the potential of a left-leaning Supreme Court.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But things are different this year. Sevcik feels free to look at other options given the court's current conservative majority. She became a first-time grandmother this summer, which has elevated issues such as 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and public health. She can't stomach the way Trump has rebuffed scientific experts and his inflammatory style, which she thinks is unbecoming of the office of the president. At the same time, Sevcik still believes the GOP still handles the economy better and the Democratic Party often "makes me uncomfortable with their liberal views."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last week Sevcik was undecided. But this week she made up her mind. For the first time in her life, she plans to vote for a Democrat for president.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "There are too many instances I have read about (where) I tried to give Trump the benefit of the doubt," she said. "I can't do that any longer."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Jan, a retired teacher, is leaning the other way. She just wishes Trump would "keep his mouth shut."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I think he's insulting at times, too abrasive, but Joe (Biden) I don't think is strong enough," the Dunwoody resident, who declined to give her last name, said during a pre-debate interview in the parking lot of a local grocery. She cited the economy and public safety as top issues.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Like Sevcik, Lowrey's family is also divided. She has banished talk of politics inside the house to prevent fighting.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 She was leaning toward Biden until the recent Capitol Hill hearings with Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. Democrats treated DeJoy unfairly for 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  that were in the making long before Trump was in office, said Lowrey, a third-generation postal worker who spent four decades at the Postal Service before she retired.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Lowrey also can't stand the president's boastfulness, and she left Tuesday's combative debate with one thing certain in her mind: that she couldn't cast another vote for Trump.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Lowrey's daughter recently told her about the Libertarian presidential candidate, Jo Jorgensen. Lowrey is intrigued but worries voting third-party could help Trump win the election.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Now it seems like I am going to have to pick the lesser of two evils," she said, referring to Biden and Jorgensen. "And that is sad."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 A constant theme of the campaign of 2008 --- from the race for president to the state's Public Service Commission --- involves re-embracing nuclear power as a clean and available source of energy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Unfortunately, the call among candidates for more nuclear power has often been as shallow as the cry to "drill, baby, drill." Nuclear does need to be part of the nation's energy-production capacity, particularly given the role of fossil fuels in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . But nuclear power still faces long-term issues about cost and safety that have not been addressed or even acknowledged.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Three decades after the last nuclear power plant was commissioned in the United States, 21 companies have indicated they want to build 34 new reactors. In Georgia, workers have already begun clearing old buildings near Georgia Power's two Plant Vogtle reactors so two new units can be constructed. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Other steps in a nuclear revival won't be so simple. For example, as Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Dale Klein pointed out last week in Atlanta, the agency needs a new generation of scientists, engineers and skilled workers to ensure the safety and security of the nation's nuclear generators. The NRC has already awarded $20 million to 60 universities for scholarships and faculty recruitment and retention to ramp up for a decade or more of new nuclear development.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While many older Americans remember the 1979 reactor incident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear plant and the explosion at Ukraine's Chernobyl plant in 1986, nuclear power didn't fall out of favor in the U.S. because of safety issues alone. Construction of nuclear plants ceased because they were prohibitively expensive to build and ratepayers eventually balked at the higher bills they were forced to pay.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Nuclear plants remain much more expensive to build than coal-fired or natural-gas plants --- they take much more concrete and steel and are much more complex, as well. However, costs have been mitigated in recent years in part because designs have been standardized. Most proposed new plants are planned on existing sites, meaning that there will be no cost for land.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Moreover, Congress has pushed the nuclear revival by providing almost $20 billion in loan guarantees and operating subsidies similar to what's available for companies investing in solar and wind power.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The NRC is also trying to lower costs by streamlining its application and approval process. In the past, that process often took as long as a decade. Under existing rules, the NRC has allocated a 30-month window to review an application followed by 12 months for public hearings. But Klein, the NRC chairman, believes that once the first two or three licenses have been granted, the pace could be accelerated. As always, however, the primary goal must be safety, not speed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The industry also has no solution to its most daunting safety and security problem, the permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel. The NRC was supposed to start accepting spent fuel rods 10 years ago at the Yucca Mountain depository in Nevada, but instead the agency is still trying to decide whether the site is suitable, with a decision about accepting waste expected to come no earlier than 2011. Meanwhile, spent fuel is kept on plant sites, many of which are approaching 30 years of age. As an interim solution, the industry wants an above-ground centralized storage site --- probably in a desert facility --- until underground storage like that planned for Yucca Mountain is available.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That would not come cheaply or quickly, and anti-nuclear groups raise a valid point in questioning whether the money might be more efficiently invested in alternative energy and conservation. Even with more standardized construction and joint ventures to share the cost of creating reactor components, the cost of nuclear-power capacity is about $8,000 a kilowatt compared with about half that for coal, according to a recent Florida Power & Light estimate.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Investments in conservation and alternative sources should be given priority, particularly if they are cost-competitive, but inevitably, additional sources of energy are going to be needed. The threat of global warming demands that safe and affordable nuclear power helps meet that need.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Southern Co. CEO David Ratcliffe has two views of the potential impact of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  legislation now making its way through the U.S. Senate after the House passed a version last summer.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It could be awful," he said Monday during a speech at the Rotary Club of Atlanta.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Or, "It could be more reasonable."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For Ratcliffe, who runs the Atlanta-based parent of Georgia Power, "reasonable" means government granting more time to the electric power industry to develop and deploy the technologies necessary to reduce its carbon emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That might mean requiring a 14 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 instead of the 17 percent or 20 percent reduction targeted in the House and Senate, respectively. Southern also has backed an 80 percent reduction by 2050.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Requiring anything more or sooner would cost a lot of money, Ratcliffe said, because it would mean making greater use of price-volatile natural gas. It would also lead to a greater reliance on natural gas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I don't think that's good energy policy," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Ratcliffe again advocated for cleaner coal technology as well as the development of renewable energy sources, particularly biomass, and nuclear power.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Southern gets 70 percent of its power from coal. Abandoning coal, he said, would be the "worst mistake" the nation could make.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Ratcliffe said Southern would produce more nuclear power with the completion of two new reactors under way at its Plant Vogtle facility near Augusta. The project will not increase nuclear's percentage of the company's power source mix because of increased demands for electricity in the future, he said.

\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  protest ever.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The movement--here and internationally -- is being led by young people. And they're demanding to be heard.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I believe our politicians are taking pity on us because we are younger than adults and they feel we don't have a voice because we aren't old enough to vote," said Jordan Madden, 15, a sophomore at Mt. Zion High School in Jonesboro. "Young people across the country have the power to make 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Madden has been rallying students in Clayton County to attend the Youth 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Strike in Atlanta at the state Capitol. It is his first time helping to organize a 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  strike and like many young people across the state, he is driven by the impact 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  could have on their lives. "Our politicians now are not taking it as seriously as it needs to be taken," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Demonstrators in 150 countries and at 2,500 locations, including 900 in the U.S. and across Georgia, are expected to participate. The strikes, today and Sept. 27, are timed to coincide with a week of events in New York City, beginning with the United Nations Youth 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Summit on Saturday and continuing through the United Nations 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Action Summit which runs from Sept. 24-30.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It has been just over a year since Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old environmental activist from Sweden, became the global face of a movement when she skipped school and sat outside the parliament building in that country asking for more action on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . She began regularly skipping classes on Fridays and invited other students to join her weekly "Fridays for Future" protests. By November, tens of thousands of students in more than 20 countries were participating in the School Strike for 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and Thunberg was elevated to the role of youth 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  guru speaking at events around Europe.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It didn't take long for her efforts to inspire students in the U.S. and other countries, growing the number of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  strikers to more than 3.6 million people worldwide.Metro Atlanta students have already participated in several strikes this year in March and May also at the Capitol.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This time, Thunberg is calling on adults to show up as well.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It is important for us to give the kids a voice and make sure they are in a safe place to be heard," said Sloan Richardson, 45, store manager at a Buckhead Patagonia. The company is one of several brands, including Lush Cosmetics and Ben & Jerry's, that will close its stores or open late to allow employees to support youth activists. Age doesn't matter when it comes to the importance of the environment, Richardson said, but it is young people who will inherit the future earth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That has propelled many young 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  activists from the sidelines to real action, but leaving school in the middle of a school day hasn't been without issue. School districts such as New York City and Portland will allow students an excused absence with a note from parents, others such as Seattle Public Schools have said absence for any reason outside of those generally approved will not be excused. Seattle students have school officials to reconsider. When some students from Lovett School in Atlanta participated in previous 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  strikes, school policy required a note from parents to attend a non-school related event off campus during the school day, said a school spokesperson. Local student organizers said teachers and professors at some schools and colleges are planning to attend the Atlanta strike along with their students.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Madden will attend the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  strike at the Capitol after school. For him, adult engagement is important but he has been most inspired by other youth including Jackson Hinkle, the 18-year-old who decided to run for city council in San Clemente, California. "If young people can influence politicians, they can make 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," Madden said. "We have already seen this in the 1960s with the Civil Rights Movement."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Then, as now, sometimes action must be bold. Michelle Douglas, 20, a student at the University of Georgia, majoring in environmental engineering got involved in November when she discovered the organization Earth Strike International. While she will participate in today's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  strike in Athens, she is helping to organize a Sept. 27 event in Atlanta that goes a step beyond protest, she said. The Southeast 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Strike and Rebellion encourages action by creating an inconvenience.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 After several days of training, hundreds of people will meet at the Buckhead MARTA station for a street party designed to stop the flow of traffic and interrupt the local economy, Douglas said. "School strikes got young people participating and working for 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  but ultimately it is not enough," she said. "This is not a protest, it is an action.The intent is to disrupt."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 When ancient fossils of creatures that live on the ocean floor have been found in rock formations at the summit of Mount Everest, that ought to give us a clue that big 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the earth are nothing new, and that huge 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  have been going on long before human beings appeared on the scene.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The recent statement that the earth was warmer in the Middle Ages than it is today, made by the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientist who is at the heart of the recent scandal about "global warming" statistics, ought to at least give pause to those who are determined to believe that human beings must be the reason for "
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Other 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists have pointed out before now that the earth has warmed and cooled many times over the centuries. Contrary to the impression created in much of the media and in politics, no one has denied that temperatures 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , sometimes more than they are 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  today.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Three years ago, a book by S. Fred Singer and Dennis T. Avery was published with a title that says it all: "Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1500 Years."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Contrary to clever political spin that likened those who refused to join the "global warming" hysteria to people who denied the Holocaust, no one denied that 
\f1\i\b \ul climates change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Indeed, some of the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists who have been the biggest critics of the current hysteria have pointed out that 
\f1\i\b \ul climates
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  had 
\f1\i\b \ul changed
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  back and forth, long before human beings created industrial societies or drove SUVs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It is those who have been pushing the hysteria who have been playing fast and loose with the facts, wanting to keep crucial data from becoming public, and even "losing" some of that data that supposedly proved the most dire consequences.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It has not been facts but computer models at the heart of the "global warming" crusade.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Nothing is easier than coming up with computer models that prove almost anything.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Back during the 1970s, there were computer models predicting mass starvation and global cooling.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The utter failure of those predictions ought to make us at least skeptical of computer models, especially computer models based on data that advocates want to keep from public view or even "lose" when investigators start closing in.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 On 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  issues, as on many other issues, the biggest argument of the left has been that there is no argument.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The word "science" has been used as a magic mantra to shut up critics, even when those critics have been scientists with international reputations as specialists in 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  science.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Stealing the aura of science for political purposes is nothing new for the left.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Karl Marx called his brand of Utopianism "scientific socialism."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Even earlier, in the 18th century, the Marquis de Condorcet referred to "engineering" society.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In the 20th century, H.G. Wells referred to the creation of a lasting peace as a heavy and complex "piece of mental engineering."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Genuine science is the opposite of dogmatism, but that does not keep dogmatists from invoking the name of science in order to shut off debate.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Science is a method of analysis, rather than simply a set of conclusions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In fact, much of the history of science is a history of having to abandon the prevailing conclusions among scientists in light of new evidence or new methods of analysis.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 When the scientists in England who were promoting "global warming" hysteria sent e-mails out to colleagues, urging them not to reveal certain data and not to let the fact become widely known that there was a freedom-of-information act in Britain, they were behaving like politicians, rather than scientists.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The huge political, financial and ideological investment of many individuals and institutions in the "global warming" hysteria makes it virtually impossible for many of the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  crusaders to gamble it all on a roll of the dice, which is what empirical verification is. It is far safer to dogmatize and to demonize those who think otherwise.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Educators who turn schools into indoctrination centers have been going all out to propagandize a whole generation with Al Gore's movie, "An Inconvenient Truth" --- which has in fact carried a message that has been very convenient for Al Gore financially, producing millions of dollars from his "green" activities.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 I have granddaughters -- 6 and 4 years old -- living in Florida. My biggest concern for their future does not involve war and peace, the economy, international or race relations, education, job opportunities, immigration or even North Korea. When pushed, we seem to solve those problems. I am primarily concerned about the future of our environment. Will they have clean air, water, food and residential areas safe from the destructive force of mega storms?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Despite overwhelming evidence that man-made carbon emissions are causing intensified global warming, we continue to elect people who drag their feet on imposing solutions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A cursory review of the Congressional Record establishes that every GOP senator and representative from Georgia has either denied the existence of global warming, or rejected evidence of a connection with carbon emissions. How and why did treating our environment with such disdain become the "secret handshake" of our Republican Party?

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Georgia halted work Wednesday on plans to meet new federal rules to fight global warming, after the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Obama administration from imposing them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The decision was roundly applauded by politicians and industry officials in Georgia who complained that the mandated carbon reductions from coal-fired power plants --- 25 percent statewide by 2030 --- would hurt businesses and ratepayers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia joined 28 other states last year in a lawsuit against the president's Clean Power Plan. Gov. Nathan Deal nonetheless directed the state's environmental agency to start on a compliance plan.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Wednesday, a day after the high court stopped the rules pending further legal review, the state Environmental Protection Division said it has postponed research and stakeholder meetings devoted to the Clean Power Plan.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We are pleased that Georgia will not need to begin plan development at this time given the uncertainties surrounding its ultimate legal status," said Mary Walker, an assistant EPD director.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last summer the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency mandated that states reduce carbon emissions by one-third, with compliance plans due later this year. Coal-fired electric power plants were targeted.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A district court will hear arguments in the states' case June 2, and the Supreme Court could take it up by mid-2017.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We will continue to fight this executive overreach which will put Americans out of work and drive up the cost of electricity for consumers," Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said in a statement.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Environmentalists lamented the decision. It "hits pause on the country's strongest action to lower harmful carbon pollution," said Frank Rambo, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia was expected to rather easily meet the EPA guidelines. Its carbon-emission targets were relaxed from earlier goals and the state also received credit for the under-construction nuclear power Plant Vogtle.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 POWDER SPRINGS -- When the Rev. Raphael Warnock arrived at the Powder Springs Amphitheater for a political rally Saturday he was not happy with the reception he got.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 So he employed a trick honed from his work in the Baptist Church.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I can't hear you," he yelled, momentarily transforming the stage to a pulpit. "I'm a Baptist preacher. ... Hello everybody!!"
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The crowd roared.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It is that ability to appeal to voters as a pastor of one of the most important churches in the nation while slowly transitioning into a politician that has positioned Warnock as a front-runner in a contentious 21-candidate race for the U.S. Senate.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Before Warnock spoke, eight candidates for local and state offices hit the stage. But everyone was there to see Warnock, who is attempting to make history by climbing out of Savannah's Kayton Homes projects to become Georgia's first Black U.S. senator and just the 11th African American to serve in the Senate since Hiram Revels was elected to represent Mississippi in 1870.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Warnock -- a 51-year-old who had never run for political office before but holds solid name recognition as the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, the home church of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. --is trying to unseat conservative Republican Kelly Loeffler.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A recent Quinnipiac University poll had him leading the field at 31%, and his campaign is reporting that he has raised over $12.8 million over the past three months. In previous filings, he's out-raised both Loeffler, who is self-financing her campaign, and U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, another formidable Republican in the race. Warnock is not accepting any corporate PAC money.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In addition, prominent local and national Democrats are backing him while at the same time urging other members of the party -- namely Matt Lieberman and Ed Tarver, who have no significant campaign funding-- to drop out in an improbable play to get Warnock over 50% of the vote in November. Warnock, though, has not asked any candidate to exit the contest.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Warnock's campaign has also benefited from the bitter Republican-on-Republican feud between Loeffler and Collins, which has distracted GOP attention away from attacking his record.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He did face criticism in April, but that was from Tarver, who called on the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to rescind its endorsement of Warnock after news broke about a minor domestic incident between the pastor and his then-wife.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But as Warnock has risen in the polls, Republicans have begun mining his old sermons and speeches.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 On Monday, the GOP began circulating video from 2013 of Warnock describing capital punishment as "part of a conservative backlash in the years immediately following the civil rights movement."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "In a real sense, it is the final failsafe of white supremacy, for the data clearly show that its use ensures that in the final analysis, the lives of white people are to be regarded as more valuable than the lives of Black people," Warnock said in the speech.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Warnockhaslongopposed the death penalty and was a leading advocate for Troy Davis, who was executed in 2011 in the slaying of a police officer despite evidence that supported his innocence.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In his messaging and on the campaign trail it is easy to see how the gospel according to Warnock is playing out.He has said several times that, now more than ever, the Senate needs a pastor.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We are at an inflection point in American history," Warnock said. "There is a fundamental question about the character of our country and the soul of our nation. We are in a spiritual crisis."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 'Passion for justice'
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As Loeffler and Collins have tried to outdo each other in courting Trump and other conservatives, Warnock has comfortably settled into his liberal platform focusing on expanding access to health care, protecting voting rights, fighting for worker rights and addressing criminal justice. As a pastor, he has spent his life at bedsides and in hospitals tending to the sick and dying.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In June, shortly after preaching at the funeral of Rayshard Brooks, a Black man killed by an Atlanta police officer, Warnock headed to South Georgia to welcome the release of his brother Keith, who in 1997 was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent drug-related offense.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The son of two pastors, Warnock is the 11th of a dozen kids and the first to go to college. In 2005, at age 35, he was tapped to lead Ebenezer. Shortly after arriving he led a "Freedom Caravan" of Hurricane Katrina evacuees back to New Orleans to vote in person.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It was then that state Sen. Nan Orrock met Warnock for the first time.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I saw then a person very passionate about justice, voting rights and working to meet the needs of those who are in dire straits," Orrock said. "Now, 15 years later, I am grateful that he is willing to plunge into this battle. He is a man of keen intellect, a strong work ethic and the ability to see things differently. That is needed in the U.S. Senate."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 SincebecomingEbenezer's pastor, Warnock has led voter registration drives, advocated for the expansion of Medicaid, hosted a 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  summit with Al Gore and pushed for an overhaul of criminal justice policy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "It is about my passion for justice," said Warnock, who marked his 15th anniversary at Ebenezer on Sunday. "I am not in love with politics, but I am in love with humanity. Politics is a tool to effect the kind of 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  that I want to see in the world."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Virus forces 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Just six weeks into his campaign, the world stopped at the feet of the coronavirus, forcing Warnock to make his adjustment from the pulpit to the campaign virtually. Ebenezer has opened just twice since the pandemic -- for the funerals of Brooks and U.S. Rep. John Lewis -- so he tapes his sermons to be delivered on Sundays.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He can't knock on doors, kiss babies or sit in living rooms. Instead, he does Zoom.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rallies like the one in Powder Springs are carefully socially distanced, and everyone wears masks. Immediately after speaking Saturday, Warnock placed his mask back on his face while an aid squirted him with hand sanitizer.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Monica Brookings Wells and her husband, Jonathan, stood in the crowd and hung on every word out of Warnock's mouth. They live in Powder Springs and are members of Ebenezer. This was their first time seeing their pastor in person in months.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "If you have ever gone to one of his sermons, you will see how focused he is,"Wells said. "And that translates on the campaign trail. He sounds like what he needs to sound like, and he is going to stay focused."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Warnock's visit to Powder Springs was the second of three rallies in metro Atlanta that day. After his stump speech, he took questions. Then, dozens in masks lined up to take their photograph with Warnock.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Finally, at 4:45 p.m., he was done, leaving him 15 minutes to get to Riverdale for another rally.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "If the people in this state, whose children need student loans and who are in the Medicaid gap and who suffer through bouts of food insecurity across racial lines, will rise up and make their way to the polls, we will 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  this state in one election cycle," Warnock said. "A vote is a kind of prayer, a prayer for the kind of world we want to live in."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Eight short years ago, when Al Gore ran for president, his views on global warming inspired widespread scoffing and jokes. The vice president was "Owl Gore" and "Nature Boy," or, as the first President Bush sometimes called him, "Ozone Man."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 However, as 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the planet's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  have become more and more undeniable, the political 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  has slowly begun to 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  as well. Once-frozen attitudes are beginning to thaw; once-solid opposition to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  science is finally beginning to melt. And maybe, just maybe, on this 38th anniversary of Earth Day, the time for real progress draws near.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It is notable, for example, that U.S. Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee for president, accepts the reality of man-made global warming and the need to address it effectively. His campaign describes him as "a leader on the issue of global warming, with the courage to call the nation to action on an issue we can no longer afford to ignore." As McCain sees it, "Ignoring the problem reflects a 'liberal live-for-today' attitude unworthy of our great country."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And McCain is hardly alone. Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker of the House, has cut a TV spot with current Speaker Nancy Pelosi, urging investment in clean energy as a way to address 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Our country must take action to address 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," Gingrich says in the commercial. "If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 President Bush, an ex-oil man, also grudgingly acknowledges that the planet is heating, that mankind is driving much of that 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and that international action is required. Last week, he endorsed an approach that "will require commitments by all major economies to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gas emissions," even if Bush's proposed timetable for that 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is impossibly slow.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Even Republican governors, including those in neighboring Florida and South Carolina, are advocating a 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in their party's approach to global warming. As Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina puts it, on the issue of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , Republicans "have conceded the high ground to those on the far left."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Of course, there are always those reluctant to accept an inconvenient truth, and Georgia Republicans too often are among them. While the rest of the world and much of their own party have come to grips with the reality of global warming, Republican legislators here in Georgia take a stubborn pride in their ignorance. While other states take steps to address the issue, Georgia legislators schedule "hearings" dominated by 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  deniers who long ago lost credibility elsewhere.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While that reflects poorly on Georgia and the wisdom of its leadership, on a global scale it really doesn't matter much. The scientific debate on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and its causes is drawing to a close, as statements by McCain, Bush and other prominent Republicans demonstrate. Regardless of the outcome of this year's election, the next stage will be a political debate about how best to respond, not whether to respond at all.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Hundreds of students and adults converged on the state Capitol on Friday afternoon to demand government officials take action on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . The crowd, some of whom left school or work to participate in the event, joined protesters around the world who took part in the Youth 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Strike, the youth-led 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  movement inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Officials estimated at least 200 people attended the Atlanta strike, which touched on a range of environmental issues from renewable energy to the importance of plant-based diets. In addition to a series of youth speakers, several politicians including Senate hopefuls Jon Ossoff and Ted Terry made appearances at the event.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The international movement is being billed as possibly the largest 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  demonstration ever, with protests expected in 150 countries at 2,500 locations, including several in Georgia. Friday's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  strikes, and another set for Sept.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 27, coincide with the upcoming United Nations Youth 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Summit today and continuing through the United Nations 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Action Summit, which begins Tuesday.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Leaders of Georgia's youth actions have published a list of environmental policies they want state lawmakers to approve including reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and further protections for forests and wildlife.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Marching from Atlanta City Hall to the Capitol, protesters carried signswith slogans reading "Denial is not a policy" and "Kill the humans save the forest." The crowd included students from across metro Atlanta, including about 50 students from Decatur High School.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We recognize this is an urgent problem that is not going to stop until something happens," said Lily Mae Barcik, 14, a freshman at Decatur High who also attended a previous 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  strike as a middle school student.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We are trying to use what power we have," said Melissa Mauldin, 14, also a freshman.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Even the youngest children in attendance wanted to be sure their voices were heard. Roen Weisinger, 8, told his mother he wanted to attend the strike. "I want to stop global warming. I don't want the world to heat up and kill all the animals," he said while carrying a sign that read, "I will fight for the earth."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some schools in the metro area, including Morningside Elementary in Atlanta, hosted strikes on school grounds to allow students to participate without leaving campus. At Tallulah Montessori on Atlanta's west side, owners Alex and Heather Wolf decided to close school for the day to attend the rally with their children, Reanna, 12, and Maya, 4, and other school families. "We knew it would be upsetting to some parents, but we got a lot of support,"said Heather Wolf.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Thunberg, who attended the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  strikes in New York, had asked adults to join young people in protest this time. "We do our little bit, but we have to do more," said Mildred Retana, 33, of Cumming, who attended with her 9-year-old niece. "It is important for her to see how many people care about the environment." Retana, who owns a restaurant that uses compostable containers and does not offer plastic straws, said 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  can be hard but it is necessary.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As the strike got underway, Jairo Garcia, co-chair of the 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Reality Project and former director of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  policy for the city of Atlanta, noted that despite the city's commitment to 100% clean energy, there has been little forward movement in the two years since the announcement. "We have to move faster," Garcia said. "We have the technology and intellect, we just have to get the politicians on board."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Terry, mayor of Clarkston, who is running for U.S. Senate, told the crowd he fully endorsed the Green New Deal, a congressional resolution that lays out a plan to help transition from an economy based on fossil fuel to one based on clean energy as well as address issues of inequality.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Ossoff said it was time for young people to make their voices heard. "Our elected officials are bought and paid for by the fossil fuel industry," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Other speakers urged the young people in the crowd to educate themselves about issues such as coal ash and renewable energy and suggested they devote 15 minutes to reading the Green New Deal.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Hannah Testa, a 16-yearold environmental activist from Cumming, called on the crowd to vote for elected officials who would take action on the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  crisis. "We should not have to fight to have our voices heard by politicians," she said from the steps of the Capitol. "We should not have to fight our own government to protect the planet."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 NEW YORK--Exxon Mobil Corp. won Tuesday in a closely watched lawsuit over the costs of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , with a judge saying there was no proof the energy giant duped investors about the toll that regulations could take on its business.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 New York Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't prove the company made any material misstatements "that misled any reasonable investor," state judge Barry Ostrager wrote in dismissing the case. "Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve Exxon Mobil from responsibility for contributing to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  through the emission of greenhouse gases," he added. "But Exxon Mobil is in the business of producing energy, and this is a securities fraud case, not a 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  case."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Exxon Mobil hailed the ruling. "We provided our investors with accurate information on the risks of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," the Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement. "Lawsuits that waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 James, however, said the case "laid out how Exxon made materially false, misleading and confusing representations to the American people about the company's response to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  regulations."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The oil giant never took seriously the severe economic impact that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  regulations would have on the company, contrary to what they were telling the public," the Democrat said in a statement. The suit sought an estimated $476 million to $1.6 billion in restitution to shareholders. It also was seen as something of a bellwether for how investors view energy companies' prospects in light of global warming and new regulations it's expected to spur.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The lawsuit accused Exxon Mobil of essentially keeping two sets of books -- telling the public that it was fully taking into account the costs of potential future 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  regulations in a warming world, while lowballing those costs behind the scenes as it made investment decisions and assessed the value of its oil and gas reserves. Scientists have warned that the world must cut emissions from the burning of fossil fuels to stave off the worst effects of warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The judge noted there was no testimony from any actual investors who claimed to have been deceived and called the lawsuit "hyperbolic."

Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Steve Descano said Trooper Charles Hewitt's conduct was reprehensible, but that the stop of Derrick Thompson, Hewitt's request forThompson to leave his vehicle and the amount of force used on Thompson were legal.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Last week's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  rally in downtown Atlanta gave way Friday to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  protests that saw nearly 20 arrests as demonstrators attempted to block some of metro Atlanta's busiest streets.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The protests -- organized by Extinction Rebellion Atlanta, part of an international movement to fight 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  through direct action and civil disobedience -- drew about 200 people who stopped traffic on Peachtree Road in Buckhead and near 10th and Peachtree in Midtown. According to police, 19 people were arrested during the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  protests.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The event capped a week of international protests in 150 countries and thousands of locations, including several across Georgia. Designed to coincide with the United Nations 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Action Summit, protesters hoped to create awareness about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and urge lawmakers to take action.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is a product of our own miscalculations," said Laurel Wheatley, 18, a student at Georgia State University and a first-time protester along with her friend, Danae Antoine, 19.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We have to be active about it," Antoine said. "This is our future."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In metro Atlanta, the protests included a Sept. 20 youth-led protest inspired by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist, in which about 200 students and adults rallied on the steps of the state Capitol. A number of smaller protests also took place at metro area K-12 schools and college campuses throughout the week. Friday's demonstration was specifically planned as an act of civil disobedience.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The crowd gathered at 9:30 a.m. at the Buckhead MARTA station and began its march through the streets. The group intended to stop at the intersection of Peachtree Road and Piedmont to set up a street party with music, performances and speeches throughout the day, but police stopped protesters attempting to set up barricades in the street near Terminus Road.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Police quickly cuffed and detained those who tried to move around the police blockade or remain in the street. Some protesters were arrested on the sidewalk.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Of the 19 arrested, the majority were charged with wearing a mask, which is prohibited by law in most cases, or pedestrian on or along the roadway. Some were charged with disorderly conduct or prohibited conduct during assemblies. Individuals who were cited with "wearing a mask" were taken to the Fulton County Jail, while all others were taken to city jail, said Carlos Campos, spokesman for the Atlanta Police Department.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Campos declined to give the number of officers deployed on Friday, only stating that it was an adequate number to ensure the safety of pedestrians and motorists.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Many protesters were prepared for a full day of action to disrupt "business as usual" across metro Atlanta.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We are out here to raise awareness, and if that means we have to go to jail, so be it," said Scot Hollonbeck, 49, a dad from Decatur, his wheelchair adorned with Extinction Rebellion flags. "I'm tired of signing petitions and asking nicely. We are all complicit in this."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Later in the afternoon, about 120 protesters gathered in Piedmont Park to regroup and decide their next move.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The point was disruption. This is an emergency," said Jordan Streiff, 35, of Extinction Rebellion Atlanta. "The goal of Extinction Rebellion and its allied organizations who are here is to raise the alarm while we still have some time to act." He said this is just the start of more actions to come in the Southeast.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Cooperation needed to keep voters, poll workers safe
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I work our elections. I feel good about doing the job, in spite of the long days. With the pandemic, I worked the primary and runoff. I now have doubts about Nov. 3. This election will be very busy. I've reached out to local officials, the Gwinnett County Board of Elections, as well as supervisors. I was told we must wear masks; however, for voters, the consensus is that the law does not allow enforcing mask-wearing as a condition for voting. Mostly older citizens work the elections. With the pandemic, older people are most vulnerable. It is difficult to find people willing to take this on. I wonder how many people know or think about this. If you don't work the polls and don't trust the mail, shouldn't you be willing to wear a mask for those willing to be there? Please be considerate. Use face coverings, social-distance and be prepared, whether voting early or on Nov. 3.

\f3\fs20 When will right become pro-life beyond abortion?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Conservatives think they're the only Americans who are pro-life. Not true; all Americans believe in the sanctity of life. But for many of us, pro-life includes more than the yet-to-be-born. When confronted with thousands dead from gun violence, conservatives counter with the Second Amendment. When future lives are at risk due to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , the answer is, "Don't believe it. Fake science!" When Black Americans are murdered by the state, the pushback is, "Well, they probably deserved it." When immigrant children are torn from their parents and then die while in custody, the reasoning is, "They should stay home!" When people die on our streets from hunger and cold, it's because they didn't make good choices. And while wearing a mask has proven to save lives, we hear, "Don't tread on my rights!" The "right" is eager to claim they are pro-life. We are waiting for them to show it.

\f3\fs20 Free markets triumph despite liberal politician
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In this era of pandemic, it is fascinating to me to see the acceleration of the e-economy. The digital online procurement of goods and services for our homes and businesses was underway prior to the pandemic, but COVID-19 clearly brought a light-speed 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in our behaviors. Regarding "Amazon to add 4K jobs in metro area" (News, Sept. 15), I can't help but think about U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's opposition to Amazon's HQ2 in Queens, New York. Jobs and an increase in employment will increase individuals' access to corporate-sponsored health care as well as create more jobs by a multiplier effect: Workers with money will consume other goods and services. With approximately 13 million unemployed in the U.S., expansion and hiring by Amazon of 100,000 nationally is refreshing. Was AOC right to stifle economic development in her district? I think the pandemic has answered that question.

The article on Trump's taxes ( "President's tax data reveals heavy losses, tax avoidance," News, Sept. 28) belonged above the fold and in the uppermost right hand side. I do not know when you put your paper to bed, but the story was out at 5 p.m. on Sept. 27. Your politics are showing.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Last year was one of the hottest years on record, according to a new government report confirming the Earth's continued warming trend. Greenhouse gases were also at the highest level on record, reaching levels unseen for more than a half-century.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The annual State of the 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  report, led by scientists at the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information, reviews the world's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  with contributions from more than 520 scientists in 60 countries.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "What came through this year was a real continuation of some of the patterns we have seen in recent decades where it is not just temperature.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 There are dozens of other diagnostics, and almost unanimously they are showing that we are in a warming world," said Deke Arndt, climatologist for NOAA.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Though the report measures global trends, the local impact included above-aver-age temperatures recorded over most of the Southeast during autumn. Those high temperatures along with several extremes helped make 2019 the hottest year on record in metro Atlanta since the first full year of data was collected in 1879.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Under the background of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , the Southeast is undergoing and will undergo more extremes," said state climatologist Bill Murphey. "You will get more alternating colder and hotter days and more wetter or drier conditions."One example was the flash droughts last fall that left lakes and rivers across the state at below-average water levels and left some Georgia farmers with drought-related
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 crop losses.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last year, the average annual temperature globally was 0.79 to 1 degree Fahrenheit above the 1981-2010 average. Though 2016 remains the hottest year, the six warmest years on record have all occurred in the past six years beginning in 2014, said the report.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In addition, greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, hit peak levels in 2019, trapping 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone -altering heatin the atmosphere. The increase in temperatures driven by greenhouse gases is almost entirely human caused, Arndt said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Fossil fuel consumption or production and deforestation are the largest human-caused factors resulting in increased greenhouse gases, followed to a lesser extent by some agricultural processes and the carbon-intensive production of concrete, Arndt said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Only a record El Nino in 2016 outpaced the average sea surface temperature of 2019.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms addressed a U.S. Senate committee Wednesday about the city's efforts to combat 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Bottoms was on a panel of five mayors who testified at the first meeting of the Senate Democrats' Special Committee on the 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Crisis.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The hearing was intended to showcase large cities' strategies to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to new challenges stemming from 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . The mayors also discussed how the federal government can help their cities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Bottoms talked about several projects in Atlanta that she sees as key to combating 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone --now and in the future.Among them: the city's new reservoir and the new 280-acre park that Bottoms said will help "mitigate historic flood problems" in Northwest Atlanta.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Bottoms' remarks also focused on the impact that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  has on Atlanta's most vulnerable populations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 One of the problems that come with rising temperatures is an increase in ground-level ozone, which aggravates asthma symptoms. This disproportionately affects African Americans, who are three times more likely to be hospitalized and die because of asthma compared to white people, the mayor said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We see an average of 26,000 emergency room visits for asthma and wheezing in Atlanta every year, and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  will only make it worse," Bottoms said at the hearing, noting her own four children suffer from asthma.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Bottoms was the only mayor of a Southern city and the only female mayor to testify at the hearing.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 She joined Mayor Kirk Cardwell of Honolulu;Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul, Minnesota; Mayor William Peduto of Pittsburgh; and Mayor Ted Wheeler of Portland, Oregon.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Bottoms also noted the impact 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  will have on power bills. Low-in-come Atlanta residents already have the third-high-est energy burden in the nation, and higher temperatures will only worsen that, Bottoms said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Bottoms said Atlanta would benefit from an expansion of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The program, run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, provides grants to low-income people to help with the cost of energy bills.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "No city can address these issues alone," Bottoms said. "Partnerships with the federal government are necessary and urgent."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 After making landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama, on Wednesday with historic flooding along the Gulf Coast, Hurricane Sally was downgraded, but the tropical storm still carried the threat of flooding as it headed toward Georgia overnight.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The slow-moving storm traveling under 10 mph was expected to drop 3 to 6 inches of rain across much of the state, with the hardest hit areas in west central and Middle Georgia getting up to 8 inches, said Steve Nelson, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Peachtree City.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 With much of the rain expected in some areas overnight Wednesday, the full extent of possible flooding and other damage wouldn't be visible until this morning. Though the amount of expected rainfall was consistent with earlier forecasts, Nelson said Wednesday afternoon the area of impact had shifted slightly to the south.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 After moving in just south of Atlanta, heavy rain from the storm was predicted to move northeast just after midnight to the middle part of the state before moving toward Augusta by midmorning today. The rain was expected to taper off by midday and clear out entirely by this evening.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some parts of the state were under a wind advisory, a
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 flashflood watch was in effect for most of North Georgia, and state officials and local utilities were on high alert for tornadoes and downed trees that could lead to widespread power outages.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Ahead of the heavy rains, state Department of Transportation crews were out clearing drains along metro Atlanta interstates and major roads. Brookhaven police closed the Peachtree Creek Greenway path. Albany State University moved all classes online today. Public schools in the county closed early Wednesday for possible severe weather.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia EMCs monitored weather conditions on Wednesday, putting all emergency personnel on standby and getting trucks and extra equipment ready to deploy. "Winds, heavy rain and flooding can blow electric poles and structures to the ground and knock trees on power lines, so the EMCs are watching developments closely for any potential damage from the storm," said spokeswoman Terri Statham.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Glen Sachtleben, deputy response division director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said staff members had been working since early Tuesday morning to make sure Alabama, Mississippi and Florida were also receiving any support they needed. The Georgia division of the state agency was also encouraging residents to prepare for potential heavy rain.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 National forecasters had predicted an above normal hurricane season for 2020 -- with about 19 to 25 named storms. Sally is the 18th named storm of the season. Still, some coastal residents said they weren't prepared for how rapidly Hurricane Sally shifted in both its direction and intensity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Marshall Shepherd, director of the Atmospheric Sciences program at the University of Georgia, said rapid 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in storms are likely the new normal.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "In an era of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , people in coastal communities are going to have move beyond the idea of being surprised or angered by rapidly intensifying storms," Shepherd said. "We have to shift the mindset to that being the new norm."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Scientists point to 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  as a factor that is making hurricanes wetter, and some studies have linked 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  to slower-moving storms. Add that to an increase in development and challenges of stormwater drainage, and the stage is set for rampant flooding, Shepherd said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Not only are we seeing a generation of more intense hurricanes, we are seeing more intense rain in general. Our flooding will be on the uptick because we have an infrastructure that is not designed for this," Shepherd said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Late Wednesday, Jennifer Pipa, CEO of Georgia Red Cross, prepared to drive to the Florida Panhandle, where shelters had been opened several days before Hurricane Sally made landfall. The agency has opened more shelters with lower capacity to remain in accordance with health guidelines on social distancing for COVID-19, she said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In Georgia, the Red Cross focused efforts on counties in the southern part of the state that historically flood during these type of events, Pipa said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We knew initially this year with the forecast it was going to be a fairly active hurricane season. It is challenging, but we are so lucky the American public believes in what we do," she said.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Science holds key to pandemic and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f0\i0\b0\fs24 \ulnone \

\f3\fs20 We owe our standard of living today to advancements in science and should appreciate messages from scientists. Our past and future progress dealing with the pandemic hinges on understanding the virus and developing solutions to its spread. Perhaps scientists will have a vaccine to save us this year. Scientists have also been warning of the dire consequences of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  unless we wean ourselves of fossil fuels and convert to renewable energies. Just as with the pandemic, scientists and industry have busily been developing clean energy solutions such that now they are cheaper than fossil fuels without even counting the effects of pollution and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , and the consequent remediation the fossil fuel industry owes us. Our dilemma is confronting the creeping effects of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  without having the sense of urgency of a pandemic. We need to pass the Carbon Fee and Dividend Act to encourage our transition to clean energy. It won't affect your wallet, but it will save our future.

We know what is necessary for our country to be successful: leadership that sets goals and lays out concise, reasonable and achievable means to reach them. The United States has always been thought of as a positive country. We could do anything, and do it well. Our relationship with other countries has been, for the most part, favorable. All that 
\f1\i\b \ul changed
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the past four years. We are as divided now as we were in the 1860s, only today it's not the North versus South, it's son versus father, brother versus brother. How do we stop this divisiveness? Maybe by voting on Nov. 3.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 There's no question we Americans are in trouble, so divided we can't see straight.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We can't see the efficacy of wearing a mask in our fight against COVID-19. We refuse to see the impact of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  on our environment. We can't even agree that the Black Lives Matter movement has nothing to do with dishonoring the flag and everything to do with saving lives.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A good many of you have heaped a lot of blame my way for daring to even point out societal ills, especially racism. Like a disgruntled spouse who resorts to absolute terms like "never" and "always" during a disagreement, you say that's all I do.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It's not all I do but I do see it as one of the most important aspects of what I do, always with the hope that you'll take another look and perhaps respond to the call to love thy neighbor as thyself.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Given all the partisan bickering, I've never felt more strongly about this, never before longed for the kind of leadership the late John Lewis embodied, someone who, with love, might steer us through the maze, who will say what they mean and mean what they say.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I tuned in recently to the first installment of "Talking Politics During Turbulent Times," a weeklong online conference sponsored by Columbia Theological Seminary and Emory University's James T. and Berta Laney Moral Leadership Program, and I think I found my answer -- at least for the short term.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In a 20-minute lecture titled "Moral Leadership During Turbulent Times," Robert Franklin, an ordained minister and professor of moral leadership at Emory University, suggested that whenever America has faced crisis and unsettling conditions, moral leaders have emerged to guide us forward by encouraging the "better angels of our natures."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Moral leaders serve the common good, and they invite us to become a better version of ourselves," he said. "At a time of great uncertainty, volatility and high anxiety about our health, safety, elections, and jobs, we need moral leaders like John Lewis who can inspire us."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Franklin also happened to be one of seven candidates vying for the chance to fill Georgia's 5th Congressional District seat left vacant by Lewis' death in July.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He faced former Atlanta City Councilman Kwanza Hall, Lewis' 2020 primary opponent Barrington Martin, retiring state Rep. Mable Thomas, former state Rep. Keisha Waites, Georgia minister Steven Muhammad and customer service representative Chase Oliver in a special election on Sept. 29. Hall and Franklin, the top two vote-getters, are headed for a Dec. 1 runoff.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I don't live in Lewis' old district, and this is not an endorsement of Franklin's candidacy. The voters of the 5th Congressional District, who chose to elect Lewis 17 times, have proved they are more than capable of making a great choice.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 What Franklin, author of "Moral Leadership: Integrity, Courage, Imagination," is proposing is less about whether he's the best candidate in this race, but more about how our politics at every level is in desperate need of empathy, a reliance on facts, sustained efforts to build community bonds and moral clarity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Before the start of the conference, I asked him why a former Morehouse College president and distinguished academic would want to run for office for the first time at age 66.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Franklin told me he made the decision soon after leaving Lewis' funeral and talking and praying with his own wife.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He said he first wants to make the point that budgets are moral documents that express our highest priorities and values. His second task would be to hold the Trump administration accountable for incompetence in managing our COVID-19 response, and various instances of ethical misconduct. And third, address the ongoing national crisis that continues to claim lives.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We've lost over 200,000 lives," Franklin said. "We need to pause and absorb that loss and grieve for our fellow citizens. I think a moral leader would call the Congress to hit the pause button and appreciate what is happening to us. Let's not just pretend these families are moving along with business as usual."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Franklin believes, too, that he could play a role in helping heal our nation's racial divide and call together people in this district to create a commission to explore ways to respond to John Lewis' call to unite and redeem the soul of the 5th Congressional District, and America.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In a moment of nostalgia, Franklin reminded me that when our republic began, the early founders stressed the importance of virtue in public leaders.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For instance, he said, when the nation was at war, Abraham Lincoln provided a powerful diagnosis of our national condition as "a house divided against itself."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "That is an apt diagnosis for our current moment," Franklin said. "19th-century America had Lincoln to help heal our national wounds and call us together. Now we have a 'divider in chief,' so we are losing the American habit and opportunity of calling forth the wisdom and strength of the people united."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Franklin said John Lewis saw our possibility to stretch just in the distance and he inspired us to do that.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "That's how I interpreted his words in The New York Times printed after his death," he said. "Together you can redeem the soul of America. That's what really called me forth to offer leadership in extending John Lewis' moral leadership agenda."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That's why Franklin's message is so important. He's in this race because he wants to provide the mature pastoral leadership that can move from policy to the more philosophical ethical themes Lewis felt were important -- being honest, having the will to develop new allies, and getting in some good trouble. Perhaps just as important for Franklin would be influencing other elected leaders to abide by those standards.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He's not angling for a political future, he told me. He simply wants to be the bridge between his friend Lewis and hopefully Nikema Williams, the Georgia Democratic Party chairwoman handpicked to run for the next full, two-year term in the Nov. 3 general election.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I'm really responding to this moment to extend John Lewis' legacy," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Before you vote this election season, what we expect from our leaders ought to be top of mind. We pay them and should receive a return on that investment. Instead of fear, polarization and confusion, they owe us hope, unity and solutions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Even if he is not elected, Franklin told me that will be his goal. I believe him.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 A record-breaking heat wave made this past May the warmest on record in metro Atlanta. Now a new study from a nonprofit science advocacy organization predicts Georgia and the rest of the nation will experience many more extreme heat days in the next several decades if there isn't significant action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Our analysis shows a hotter future that is hard to imagine today," said Kristina Dahl, senior 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientist and co-author of "Killer Heat in the United States: 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Choice and the Future of Dangerously Hot Days," the report released Tuesday by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). "Nearly everywhere, people will experience more days of dangerous heat even in the next few decades."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Southeast region, along with the Southern Great Plains, would be most impacted by the extreme heat, according to the report. Under the worst-case scenario -- one that assumes emissions continue at the current rate -- by midcentury, areas of states in these regions would experience the equivalent of three months per year on average during which temperatures feel hotter than 105 degrees.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In Georgia, cities such as Albany, Brunswick, Hines-ville and Valdosta would experience the highest frequency of extreme heat days with a heat index of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or above, according to the analysis. Metro Atlanta has historically experienced one day a year on average with a heat index of 105 degrees, said Astrid Caldas, senior 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientist for UCS and the study's co-author, but without significantly reducing the amount of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere, that number could reach more than 20 days by midcentury (the period between 2036 and 2065).
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Even though people are used to the heat, it is going to be hotter, and it will be hot for a longer period of time," said Caldas. But some 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists have expressed concerns about such dire heat scenarios that may not take mitigating factors into account.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Though there is no set standard for what constitutes an extreme heat event, the frequency of heat events classified as extreme has been on the rise since the mid-1960s, and a growing body of research attributes that rise to the increase in carbon emissions, according to the UCS report.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For the analysis, UCS scientists used a set of 18 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  models to project the frequency of days exceeding three heat index thresholds -- 90, 100 and 105 degrees -- under two emissions scenarios: "no action," in which there is no substantial reduction in emissions through late century, and "slow action," under which emissions begin to decline by midcentury. For a rapid action scenario, the data used was based on standards set forth by the goal of the Paris Agreement.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 If global average warming is limited to the goal of the Paris Agreement, the number of days per year on average with a heat index above 105 degrees in metro Atlanta by late century would be 13, as opposed to 55 if no action is taken to reduce emissions, according to the report. But Judith Curry, professor emerita of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech, cautions against using the most alarming scenarios from 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  models. Temperature extremes, particularly in cities, are modified by urbanization, air pollution and irrigation, Curry said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In June, Curry provided testimony to the House Oversight and Reform Environment Subcommittee that the perception of extreme weather events as being more frequent or intense and caused by man-made global warming is symptomatic of what she calls "weather amnesia."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "If people are worried about heat waves and they think they are bad now, look back to the 1930s, when they were really, really bad," Curry said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But Caldas said current conditions are unique and science literature has continued to confirm the relationship between carbon dioxide and global warming along with the source of those emissions as man-made -- from the burning of fossil fuels rather than natural sources. "In our view, it is fair and it is important to warn people what can happen and what will happen if we continue on this trajectory," said Caldas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The report points out the toll that extreme heat may have on certain populations, specifically outdoor workers, city dwellers,
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 low-in-come communities and people who live in areas prone to natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes or wildfires. Recommendations in the report challenge federal and local governments to take action ranging from setting national standards for protecting the health of outdoor workers to implementing and strengthening the Paris Agreement, from which President Donald Trump announced the United States' intent to withdraw.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Extreme heat is one of the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  impacts most responsive to emissions reductions," Caldas said. "It is the one 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  that is well understood."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 The truth shall set you free ... therefore, you cannot be told the truth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The truth, according to federal scientists at both NASA and NOAA, is that 2016 was the warmest year ever recorded by mankind on planet Earth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The previous record-hot year had been 2015. Prior to that, the record-setting year was 2014. These records have occurred despite conservative insistence a few years back that global warming had ceased and perhaps even begun to reverse itself. We don't yet know what the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  will do in 2017. Under our new president, we also don't know whether federal scientists who specialize in that field will still be able to collect, analyze and disseminate that data. We don't even know whether those scientists will still have jobs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Here's what we do know: We know that such a sustained global phenomenon cannot be explained away as "the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is always 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ," nor dismissed as a hoax led by China to destroy American capitalism, as our president has publicly alleged. The planetary heating that we are now witnessing within the tiny span of a human lifetime is occurring at a far more rapid pace than anything ever recorded in temperature data or data drawn from tree rings, ice cores and other scientific means that reach back hundreds of thousands of years.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As a matter of basic physics, we also know that such rapid disruption of an otherwise stable system cannot occur without a cause. We know that nothing occurring in the natural world -- not sunspots or other solar activity, for example -- could be that cause. We have one, and only one, plausible explanation for what is happening, and that is us. Rather than confront that fact and deal with it rationally, the Trump administration has begun a concerted effort to hide the evidence. All mention of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  has already been removed from the White House website. The Centers for Disease Control here in Atlanta suddenly withdrew from a long-scheduled conference on the health challenges created by 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , such as extended heat waves and the spread of tropical disease.

\f3\fs20 According to Reuters, the Environmental Protection Agency has also been ordered to shut down its main 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  webpage, and all EPA studies will now undergo political review before being released. EPA employees are already under a gag rule forbidding them to communicate with the press or the taxpayers who pay their salaries. Bob Walker, a senior science adviser to Trump, has said that NASA will be stripped of its earth-science budget and forced to cease "politically correct environmental monitoring." Back in December, the Trump transition team demanded the names of all Department of Energy employees and contractors who had attended United Nations 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  meetings or who had worked on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  data.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The demand was rejected by the Obama administration and then withdrawn, but the message had been sent. Meanwhile, the temperature reached a balmy 71 degrees here in Atlanta on Wednesday. That's the 10th day this January with temperatures of 70 or above. So far this year, we have set or tied four all-time records for high temperatures. By themselves, such localized data mean nothing. But they are being repeated month after month, year after year, across the globe. The scary part is that these are just the early signs of what threatens to be a truly profound 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  shift. We can retreat into alternative facts that may allow us to ignore that reality, for a time. But alternative facts cannot give us an alternative Earth.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Writer shows own ignorance of Islam
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While pointing out President Obama's "ignorance about Islam" on Feb. 14, the letter writer is demonstrating his own ignorance of the "barbaric faith called Islam." In fact, if one were to read some of his "barbaric" observations in isolation, it would seem as though one is reading the Old/New Testaments. On the other hand, are they prescribed in the Quran?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 ... Among other things, the letter writer mentions female-genital mutilation, which has nothing whatever to do with Islam, practiced mainly in North Africa, by Christians, Muslims and others, as a socio-cultural tradition. As to his reference to Islam's "violent history," a biblical scholar, based on comparative analysis, recently concluded, "Much to my surprise, the Islamic scriptures in the Quran are actually far less bloody and less violent than those in the Bible." But, as religions mature, we forget the original violence; he calls it "holy amnesia." I submit that sort of "amnesia" is ubiquitous.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Under the new 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  plan released by the Obama administration, Georgia will be required to reduce carbon emissions from its power plants by 25 percent over the next 15 years, a considerably more modest target than state leaders had feared.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Nonetheless, the reaction has been predictable: Such a reduction can't be accomplished, or if it can be done, it will come at enormous cost to electricity customers and the economy. As U.S. Sen. David Perdue put it, "The damaging effects of this hostile executive action will drive up energy prices for Georgia families and businesses, while the ripple effect throughout our economy will increase costs of basic necessities for those already struggling to make ends meet."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Relax. We've been through this before. Back in the early to mid-'90s, for example, the federal government classified metro Atlanta as a serious non-attainment area for air pollution, requiring the region to set a strict schedule for air-quality improvement. The reaction was much as you see today.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia Power complained that it would send electricity rates soaring. The new standards were supposed to be the "death knell" of economic development in the region, and the degree of air-quality improvement required was claimed by some to be all but impossible.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Then-Gov. Zell Miller wrote an angry letter of protest to the EPA, warning of "enormous economic and jobs consequences." For a short period, highway projects were canceled and the region was stripped of federal transportation money until it complied and committed to an improvement plan. (The state's auto emissions-inspection program is the most visible outcome of that plan.)
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Today, despite the naysayers, the air in metro Atlanta is demonstrably clearer than it was two decades ago. The eye-stinging, throat-burning ozone that routinely accumulated on hot summer days is now a rare occurrence. It's safer for human beings to play outside, work outside. It is safer to simply breathe. What supposedly couldn't be done --- or couldn't be done without turning metro Atlanta into a economic wasteland --- has in fact been largely accomplished at relatively low cost, although continued improvement is still necessary.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In many ways, complying with the Clean Power Plan should be even easier, because many of the required 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  are already underway. Georgia is already getting credit for taking coal-fired generation out of service and replacing it with nuclear power. And just a few years ago, Georgia Power steadfastly dismissed solar power as a possible option in Georgia, saying it was too expensive and the state didn't get enough sunshine; today it says that "the future of solar is bright in Georgia."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Judging from his own measured response, Gov. Nathan Deal seems to accept that reality. Rather than grandstand, Deal has instructed state officials to find the best possible way to meet the new standards. As a report last month by researchers at Georgia Tech concluded, a strategy of renewable energy and energy efficiency here in the South would not only bring us into compliance but produce "substantial collateral benefits including lower electricity bills across all customer classes, greater GDP growth, and significant reductions" in air pollution.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Last year, I retired as chief financial officer of Equifax Inc. after a career of over 30 years in business leadership and strategy consulting. Equifax, based here in Atlanta, is a world-class company that gathers and maintains information on over 220 million American consumers and millions more around the world.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In my eight years with Equifax, we built a platform for sustained growth by seeking out new opportunities while managing risks in an ever-evolving global economy. My job included continually anticipating how markets were 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and how we and our customers could adapt to come out ahead. Nothing was more challenging in recent years than navigating the company through the Great Recession and subsequent 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  in financial markets --- while ensuring we emerged better and stronger. And we did.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Now our economy faces an even greater challenge: 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A major report was released last year by the Risky Business Project, co-chaired by Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City; Henry Paulson, former U.S. secretary of the Treasury, and Tom Steyer, a successful investor. The report quantifies the real and potential economic impacts of a 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , focusing on the clearest and most economically significant of these risks: impacts to property and infrastructure, labor productivity and public health.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 According to the report, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone -related storms along our shoreline are likely to increase losses by $118 million per year, on average, by 2030. By mid-century, heat-related labor productivity declines across all sectors in Georgia may cost the state economy up to $2 billion each year.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The report's key finding was that we can significantly reduce these risks if policymakers and business leaders act now to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to a 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . The recently announced Clean Power Plan from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will help us do just that.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Clean Power Plan sets the nation's first-ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants, the largest source of the pollution driving 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . The plan is both ambitious and pragmatic. It requires our state to reduce power plant carbon emissions by 34 percent over 15 years, with the flexibility to develop and implement a plan that mitigates 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  risks and addresses the specific needs of Georgia families and businesses.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The good news is, we're already well positioned to meet our state's carbon reduction target. Significant reductions are already underway as a result of planned coal plant retirements in the state, renewable energy investments, and the $17 billion expansion at Plant Vogtle.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Clean Power Plan opponents warn about its price tag, but hitting Georgia's carbon-reduction target will only cost more if Georgia chooses a compliance strategy that relies too heavily on nuclear power --- the most expensive, complicated way to generate electricity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia's 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  energy landscape already shows our path to success is through renewable technologies and better efficiency. By taking advantage of these resources, Georgia will be able to reduce costs and improve reliability, while giving consumers more energy choices.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Wind and solar power, driven by improving technology and declining costs, are increasingly being adopted by utilities to reduce costs and rates compared to other sources of power, and energy efficiency is almost always the lowest-cost way to meet new electricity needs. Utilizing these affordable clean energy options will reduce carbon emissions, and also means relying less on expensive and dirty fossil fuels like coal and gas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 What happens when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine? We've got a long way to go before that should stop us. Iowa is getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind. Yet despite our progress, Georgia gets less than 1 percent of our electricity from renewable power.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 My business experience tells me investing in a modernized electricity system will create new jobs and drive more economic growth. Georgia is home to the fastest-growing solar market in the nation, and we're well positioned to one day make renewable energy a pillar of our state economy. There are already more than 173 solar companies at work in Georgia, investing $189 million to install solar on homes and businesses.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Establishing carbon pollution protections will kickstart the essential work of cleaning up and modernizing the way we power our country. Georgians should embrace the opportunity presented in the Clean Power Plan to continue to lead the way to a clean energy economy and a more stable economic future.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Marijuana is as risky as moonshine
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We were saddened by the recent stabbing death of a 17 year-old girl ("Girl, 17, allegedly killed by teen step-cousin," Metro, Nov. 16). It was suggested that marijuana was involved. When will people realize that marijuana, as an illegal substance in Georgia, is as unpredictable as moonshine was and is? Who knows what goes on it or into it? Going where it is sold is dangerous enough, but that may not be the only bad trip. Smokers should either move to a state where it is legal and tested, or leave it alone.

\f3\fs20 Stop this fear of Syrian refugees
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Republican Legislature led by Gov. Nathan Deal in Georgia is showing the world how fat and selfish we're becoming in this country. Our forefathers who dealt with British spies and countless other challenges would look aghast at how we are becoming. We see refugees, including women and children, fighting to stay alive, and we are frightened of helping them because we fear dying.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Dying is a part of life. What happened in Paris could happen anywhere. Cars kill 36 times more people in a day in this country alone than terrorists do in the entire world. Guns in this country kill more than three times more people than do terrorists throughout the world in one day. Stiffen your back, Gov. Deal, and stop making people afraid of Syrian refugees --- or any refugees, for that matter.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 WASHINGTON -- A proposal unveiled by the Trump administration on Tuesday would grant states such as Georgia more authority to decide what sorts of steps it should take to limit global warming-causing greenhouse gas emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to replace a core set of Obamaera 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  regulations with a less burdensome alternative that would "restore the rule of law" while providing "modern, reliable, and affordable energy for all Americans."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Trump administration's new Affordable Clean Energy proposal would give states broad leeway to decide how much to regulate their coal-fired power plants. That's a sharp contrast with President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan from 2015, which mandated steep reductions in carbon emissions for individual states.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Today's proposal provides the states and regulated community the certainty they need to continue environmental progress while fulfilling President Trump's goal of energy dominance," acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Few details were immediately available about how the plan, if finalized, would specifically affect Georgia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Theproposalmustundergo a 60-day public comment period and be finalized before states are given three years to pitch their compliance plans to the feds. Lawsuits from environmental groups and Democratic attorneys general are also likely.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We have just begun reading through it to find out what the proposed replacement rule is," said Karen Hays, the chief of the Georgia Environmental Protection Division's Air Protection Branch. "We will go through that process as quickly as we can and then determine whether or not Georgia wants to submit comments or has questions we want to send to EPA regarding the proposal."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 'Energy destiny'
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Throughout his campaign for president, Donald Trump vowed to revive the country's declining coal business. He blamed much of the industry's woes on his predecessor's regulatory policies, and he quickly pulled the U.S. out of the Paris 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  agreement.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But economics have also compelled utilities such as Georgia Power to decrease their use of coal in favor of cheap natural gas and increasingly accessible renewables, and that trend will likely be hard to reverse.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Coal accounted for 28 percent of Georgia's net electricity generation in 2016, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, sharply down from previous decades. That same year, 40 percent of the state's electricity was fueled by gas, 26 percent from nuclear power and 6 percent from renewable sources.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 There are five coal plants currently operational in Georgia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Despite coal's decline, Georgia fought hard against Obama's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  regulations, and Tuesday's news drew compliments from many of the state's Republicans who were sharply critical of Obama's strategy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 U.S. Sens. Johnny Isakson and David Perdue hailed the Trump plan for its flexibility. Several members of Georgia's Public Service Commission said decisions about the state's energy mix were best made in the state, not by the federal government.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Giving states more control over their energy destiny makes sense to me," said Tim Echols, the vice chairman of the PSC, which oversees the state's utilities. "The EPA Clean Power Plan was flawed in that it represented a wealth transfer from Southern states to others like California by putting a value on (carbon dioxide)."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The proposal was quickly panned by environmental groups, which saw it as a giveaway to big polluters. Many warned it would allow aging coal plants to run longer, prompting thousands of additional premature deaths and cases of asthma while moving the U.S. backward in the fight against 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Continued reliance on 19th century fuel sources is a recipe for disaster, especially when we have cleaner, safer 21st century technologies," said Jennette Gayer, the director of Environment
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Amanda Garcia, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said, "The only beneficiaries are coal-burning utilities that have been polluting our Southeastern states for decades."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 EPA officials said the new plan would lead to many of the same environmental benefits sought by the Obama administration but in a way that would delegate more authority to the states.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Legal battles
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The office of Gov. Nathan Deal did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but his administration spearheaded many of the state's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  battles with the Obama administration.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia joined more than two dozen mostly Republican states that sued the EPA in 2015 to overturn the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of Obama's quest to fight 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  using authority from the Clean Air Act.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Before the Supreme Court blocked it from going into effect, the blueprint would have required Georgia to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2030.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Boosters had framed the Obama regulations as an ambitious first step toward curtailing 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  that would also help create jobs in the clean energy sector. But critics said the plan exceeded the EPA's legal authority and would drive up energy costs for businesses and low-and middle-income customers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We worry it will be harmful to Georgia's economy," said Judson Turner, then the head of Georgia's Environmental Protection Division. "If we're going to do this, let's do it in the best way that's mindful to Georgia's business 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia similarly sued to block EPA regulations regulating new power plants and small patches of water.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia Power, the state's largest provider of electricity, said Tuesday that it was reviewing the details of Trump's Affordable Clean Energy plan. The company in recent years has shifted its portfolio toward natural gas and nuclear power as it's prepared to bring two new generating units online at Plant Vogtle.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Southern Co. supports a constructive and durable rule to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that is consistent with the Clean Air Act," spokesman Schuyler Baehman said, referring to Georgia Power's parent company.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 (Box)
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 NEW DETAILS " "
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 President
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Donald Trump signed an executive order in March 2017 calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to review its Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation aimed at sharply curtailing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The EPA
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 announced it would replace the Clean Power Plan with its own more flexible version.The Affordable Clean Energy proposal would give states broad leeway to decide how much to regulate their coal-fired power plants.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 States, power companies and other stakeholders will comment on the
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Affordable Clean Energy plan before the Trump administration moves forward with a final proposal. Then Now

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Everyone wants a greener world -- or at least says so. The path that each of us would take to get there is another matter.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Environmentalism on the political right is wholly different from environmentalism as conceived by the left. Rachel Carson drives one movement. Adam Smith powers the other.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We have just finished Clean Energy Week. No doubt, given the pandemic, you downgraded your own celebration -- perhaps to a wind-powered pinwheel and a few hotdogs on a solar-powered oven.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Conservatives for Clean Energy Georgia, a newish group dedicated to green evangelism on the right, marked the occasion with a series of quick videos featuring some of the Republicans behind this state's push for solar power.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 There wasn't a single mention of global warming or its more polite cousin, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . No fingers pointed at wildfires exploding in the West or oceanic disturbances so numerous that they have exhausted our alphabet and forced us to learn Greek.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Jobs and the pocketbook were the only languages spoken here.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Lauren "Bubba" McDonald, a 22-year veteran of the state Public Service Commission, described how he had kept his passion for solar energy closeted from his conservative friends until 2013, when he strong-armed Georgia Power to include a dose of the sun in its energy portfolio.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Market-driven, no upward pressure on the ratepayer, and no state subsidies at all," McDonald said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But it was his PSC colleague Tim Echols, who has been fascinated with alternative energy since joining the board in 2010, who made the news. A hidden cost of coal-fired power plants, which manifested itself on the bills of Georgia Power ratepayers early this year, is likely to spur the use of more solar in Georgia, Echols said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Think coal ash. The residue can contain arsenic, lead, mercury and other heavy metals toxic to humans. Plus trace amounts of hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen. Millions of tons of the stuff are stored across the state -- in 29 ash ponds and 12 landfills owned by Georgia Power.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In March, the utility told the PSC that it would cost $7.3 billion -- more than the utility's initial estimated cost of two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle -- to clean up the coal ash mess. And like the Plant Vogtle construction, the company made clear that the cost figure was subject to increase.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The cleanup project is to take 50 years. Most of the money will be spent in the next 15, and ratepayers will be asked a shoulder a major portion.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "If we had known 60 years ago how much coal ash cleanup was going to cost our ratepayers, we might have moved quicker in other forms of energy," Echols said in that video. "With solar, though, we're getting clean energy with no fuel costs."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Batteries capable of extending power delivery time beyond sundown are the key, he said. "When we add batteries to those solar arrays, I think we're going to see things 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . We're going to be able to close additional coal plants in the future."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Echols said more in another interview, published last week in a solar industry newsletter. "With coal ash disposal fees rising, solar-plus-storage may take on a special value because of lower fuel and end-of-life costs," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I called up Echols and asked for a translation. He mentioned the rate increase for Georgia Power customers that the PSC approved in December.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We're spending a good part of the rate hike on cleanup, and we're not getting anything for that. We're not getting a single kilowatt of energy out of that," he said. "That's unfortunate. There was no way to foresee it. And there certainly no way a Public Service Commission 50 years ago could have known what would have happened.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Now that we know, it will put more pressure on these coal plants. Because we do know that the end of life will bring additional costs," Echols said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It was Robert Baker, a former PSC member, who had pointed me to Georgia Power's initial cost estimates for coal ash cleanup. "You have a huge new expenditure that's going to be impacting dozens of local Georgia communities," said Baker, now an energy consultant.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia Power will report to the PSC on its progress twice a year. The problem, Baker said, is that environmental groups -- call them stakeholders if you must -- will have no opportunity to cross-examine utility officials. As they have been able to do with cost overruns at Plant Vogtle.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Civil liability may be one reason for the closed process.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In July, 45 current and former residents of Juliette and Forsyth, Ga., both communities south of Atlanta, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that a 776-acre, unlined pond adjacent to Georgia Power-owned Plant Scherer -- containing 15.7 million tons of coal ash -- had leaked toxic substances into their well water.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The cancer rate in Monroe County (home to most of Juliette and Forsyth, Georgia) is more than double the state and national averages," the lawsuit states.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia Power officials have said the lawsuit is without merit.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But the Rachel Carson side of environmentalism is on full display in the legal complaint. "According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Plant Scherer is the top single emitter of greenhouse gas emissions among all United States power plants, averaging over 20 million tons per year through at least 2018," the lawsuit states.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Echols has taken Georgia Power's side in the dispute. "I'm not convinced that Plant Scherer is the culprit," he said. "I'm paying attention to it, but it's not really in our jurisdiction."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Stacey Evans, the former Democratic candidate for governor who will return to the Legislature in January, is the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the Plant Scherer lawsuit.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Mr. Echols doesn't seem to think the 'public' in Public Service Commission would include any consideration for health effects," she said. Yet she did not quibble with his attitude toward solar power.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But back to the topic of coal ash. Echols pointed out that Georgia Power is selling small amounts of the substance to construction companies as an ingredient in concrete. More uses will be found, he predicted.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Once we close these plants, 30 or 40 years from now, all of that ash is going to be dug up. It's going to be rejuvenated, it's going to be sold, and it will be gone," Echols said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In other words, Adam Smith and the free market will save us. Eventually.

\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I enjoy the Citizens' 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate

\f1\i\b \ul climate change

It's interesting knowing eons-long events can spawn a new religion, with dedicated converts forging their sacraments -- such as taxing carbon emissions and, in some sects, promising to spread such revenue as a dividend to the masses. As in the mid-20th century, when we staved off the ice-age-to-come by creating global warming -- or 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  models to negate prior predictions -- how about we not waste energy (pun intended) and resources on fantastical endeavors trying to now fix what we really don't know how to fix? Dividing into

\f3\fs20 I was amused by a letter suggesting social ills are caused by smartphones ( "Screen dependence causes social ills," Readers Write, Dec. 12). This nation's youth face many challenges, the least of which is the smart-phone. Many of these children are fed a diet of sugar and empty calories. There is an epidemic of learning disabilities and emotional illnesses. Many children are dependent on antidepressants, anti-ADD and anti-anxiety medications. Some are attending counseling; too many are not. Some kids grow up in a violent household where verbal and even physical abuse occurs. I know kids who grow up in an overly religious environment, causing the child guilt and shame for decades. Does the writer of that letter live in such a perfect neighborhood that smartphones are the greatest threat to mental health? I wish I lived there.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 The warning is pretty stark.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Unless we figure out what to do about reduced (water) supply and increased demand, I don't think there's any way to support Atlanta's growth," says Aris Georgakakos, director of the Georgia Water Resources Institute at Georgia Tech. "There's no way."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgakakos has studied Georgia's water resources for 30 years, and over that time has seen significant 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Between 1960 and 2009, he says, the amount of water flowing through the Appalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basin, which provides most of the water for metro Atlanta, has fallen by more than 20 percent.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And the culprit is 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The Southeast is getting drier, that's for sure," Georgakakos says. "There will be more intensive droughts, more long-term droughts. It has very serious implications, because the flow in the rivers is going to decline and we've already seen a decline in all the river basins in Georgia."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgakakos was a lead author of the water-resources chapter in the recently released National 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Assessment, a congressionally mandated study of the current and projected impact of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  on the United States. He is also involved in water issues in the Middle East, Africa, China and Europe. And he expresses little doubt that the 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  documented here and around the globe are being driven by mankind.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "
\f1\i\b \ul Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is happening," he says. "Ask yourself questions: Why do you think the insurance companies left Miami? You think because they're crazy people? They're leaving Miami because the sea is rising."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Without the effect of carbon and other emissions, you cannot explain how the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  at a high rate like this, a rate that has not been historically documented before," he says. "The natural phenomenon of solar 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and volcanic eruptions --- the stuff that actually affect the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  --- cannot explain the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  of the last 50 years."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 However, given the scale of 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  that he sees looming, Georgakakos also advocates setting aside the politically sticky issue of causality to concentrate on preparation and adaptation. For example, if 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  continues on its current path, flow in the ACF river basin is projected to drop by another 20 percent over the next 50 years. Part of that decline will be due to increased withdrawals, but 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  will have by far the bigger impact.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "The problem is that if you wait two or three decades to do something, it is too late. The 50 years that we're talking about are now. The time to do something is now. The adaptation and mitigation have to begin now so we can reduce these kinds of impacts."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I wish I could get the governor and the state of Georgia to start looking at 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  as part of the planning process," he says, a tone of urgency rising in his voice. "Other states are far ahead of us. Florida, New York, California are far ahead of us, because they are already seeing its effects."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I just don't know how this is going to work out with these folks in the end," he says, his tone shifting from the urgent to the wistful.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 From now through early October is peak fall migration time for Georgia's 54 species of Neotropical songbirds -- warblers, vireos, orioles, tanagers and the like. After nesting here during spring and summer, countless numbers of them now are heading south for the winter to Caribbean islands and the tropics of Central and South America.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Joining them are as many as three dozen other southbound Neotropical species that nested elsewhere in North America and are passing through the state -- stopping maybe a few days to rest and refuel before resuming their arduous journeys to the tropics.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Do you ever wonder about these southbound travelers? How far do they go? What do they eat in the tropics? Where do they prefer to live there? What dangers do they face in tropical forests?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As far as migration distances are concerned, the number varies considerably among species and among individuals within a species. Ruby-throated hummingbirds may fly more than 2,000 miles from Georgia to Mexico and as far as Costa Rica. Common nighthawks, cliff swallows and purple martins, however, may travel as far as 6,000 miles to Argentina.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Why some Neotropical birds migrate longer distances than others probably has to do with their habitat preferences -- similar to the choices they make when returning to North America to nest in spring. For instance, the orchard oriole prefers open forests and forest edges with flowering trees in its wintering grounds from Mexico to northern South America -- similar to its spring nesting habitat in Georgia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Nearly all Neotropical migrants are primarily insect eaters, switching partly to berries around migration time. In the tropics, they maintain similar diets. The threats they face there also are similar to those facing them in North America -- deforestation; loss of habitats; predators; 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and others.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Come April, though, most of the birds will have survived to return to North America for spring nesting, and once again we will celebrate the "miracle of migration."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 IN THE SKY: From David Dundee, Tellus Science Museum astronomer: The moon will be full on Thursday night. Mercury is low in the west just after sunset. Venus rises in the east about two hours before sunrise. Mars rises in the east just after dark and will appear near the moon on Friday night. Jupiter and Saturn are high in the southeast after dark.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Is the left once again embracing Malthusian population control in order to save the planet?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Of all the preposterous proposals put forward by the Democratic presidential candidates during the CNN 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  town hall meeting last week, the dumbest wasn't outlawing plastic straws, incandescent light bulbs or air travel. It wasn't the contention that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is the globe's greatest threat since World War II. It wasn't even the fantastical hypothesis that hurricanes are racist because they target "communities of color" more than white areas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 No, the dumbest idea was a rehash of the widely discredited authoritarian idea from the 1960s and '70s: population control. Here we go again. In the 1960s, biologist Paul Ehrlich of Stanford became the patron saint of the modern population control movement with his mega-bestseller "The Population Bomb." That book -- which argued that the world was overpopulated by more than 1 billion people and the only way to save the planet from environmental doomsday was to force people to have fewer children -- became the rallying cry for Stalinistic population control measures around the world. This led to tens of millions of forced abortions, involuntary sterilization programs, forced contraception and even homicidal infanticide -- all in the name of saving the planet.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 China took the population control crusade to a whole new level when it instituted its notorious one-child policy. To this day, there are tens of millions of females demographically missing in China. The homicidal environmental policy was cheered on by the United Nations and many of the same left-wing activists and organizations that preach "reproductive freedom" and women's rights.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Fortunately, scholars like the late Julian Simon of the University of Illinois proved that human beings do not deplete the world's resources but help discover and create them. A larger number of human beings -- especially when combined with freedom and free enterprise -- leave the planet materially and environmentally better off, not worse off.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Simon also showed that freedom and prosperity are the best forms of contraception. Population growth happened because we found ways to conquer early death -- with infant mortality rates falling by 70% and 80% -- and eradicate killer diseases like smallpox and tuberculosis.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Malthusians were not just immoral; they were dead wrong on their population projections.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 All of those population forecasting models that predicted standing room only on the planet over the next 25 to 50 years were lies. These doomsday models were about as accurate as the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  models predicting catastrophic temperature 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 What the population control crowd didn't see happening was that population growth has radically slowed down -- and not because of government edicts. As people get richer and freer, couples have chosen to have fewer -- but healthier -- children. Today, in most countries, including China, the tragedy is not too many children but too few.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But at its core, the radical greens really do believe the fundamental problem with the human race is that there are too many of us. This is a fundamentally anti-Judeo-Christian ideology that disrespects human life and can lead to dastardly consequences for basic human rights and economic progress. In regard to environmental problems and the constantly 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  of our planet, human ingenuity is the solution, not the cause.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Politics can divide even friends and families.When this happens, we like to tell ourselves that the explanation lies in honest differences in values and preferences. Friends from different political parties won't really disagree, for example, about the number of workers displaced in the pandemic, but they might differ on who should bear the costs. It's another matter, however, if political conflict results from differences in information or attachments to alternative realities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It's possible to disagree -- but still engage -- with friends or fellow citizens who evaluate the benefits of test and tracing policies for COVID-19differently, but how do we communicate with someone who -- armed with the same public information -- concludes that there is no pandemic?
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We are behavioral economists who use controlled experiments in human decision-making to study political behavior. One of our current research programs finds that Americans who identify with a political party don't always vote for what they believe to be correct. Rather, assuming their vote won't matter much, they use it to express their partisan affiliation, even when their vote is anonymous.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 COVID-19 may be the exception to this rule.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Political expression before COVID-19
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In our 2018 paper, "Partisan Bias and Expressive Voting," we found that differences arise along party lines even when people vote on the answers to factual questions about politics. Rather than reflecting sincere differences in belief, we found these responses were largely "expressive," or a
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 way of affirming political identity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We conducted an online experiment in which we asked Democrats and Republicans a series of multiple choice questions about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , immigration and police shootings, among other topics.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Each question had an objectively correct answer. For example, participants were not invited to evaluate the importance of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , about which honest differences exist. Rather, they wereaskedhowmuchmeanglobal temperature had 
\f1\i\b \ul changed
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . By asking respondents to identify verifiable facts, we left no role for partisan interpretation. Instead, we focused on their willingness to acknowledge facts that may conflict with their party's preferred views.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Participants answered multiple choice questions as "individuals" or as members of small groups of "voters." Individuals received a cash bonus when their own answers were right. Voters got the bonus when a majority of their group was correct.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We speculated that someone affiliated with 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone -skeptical politicians or parties might choose one answer to the question about temperature 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  as a voter, but another, less partisan, answer as an individual. The reason is that voters who anticipate that their own response is unlikely to be decisive in determining the group's answer may prefer to express opinions that are more favorable to their own party, while individuals know that their own answer will definitely determine whether they get the bonus.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We found that, despite the financial rewards for correct responses, a partisan gap did indeed emerge among voters.On most of the questions we asked, there were substantial differences between the choices of Democrats and Republicans, with voters tending to give answers more favorable to their own party's position.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 If these gaps were purely due to differences in beliefs, then we would expect to see similar differences when people answered these questions as individuals. Instead, we found that people answering as individuals were much less partisan than people voting as part of a group.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Additionally, individuals were far more likely than voters to correctly answer questions that challenged their party's preferred views. This suggests that the partisan differences were primarily due to expression, or the desire to affirm party affiliation, rather than sincere differences in belief. On balance, we found that Republicans were more expressive than Democrats.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Cheering for your team Our findings provide fresh perspective on a long-standing theory of how and why people vote. Citizens who recognize that their vote is rarely decisive may prefer to cast their votes, not to influence the outcome of an election, but to express themselves or reaffirm their political identities. In this light, voting has been compared to cheering for a favorite sports team.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The consequences of such expressive voting behavior can be serious. Still, our initial research indicated that citizens shared a common set of facts about the world, and so provide some reason for optimism.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Unfortunately, our most recent research suggests that this isn't the case for the COVID-19 crisis and that at least some partisans seem to live in alternative realities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 COVID-19 is different
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This spring, we returned to the field with questions for more than 600 survey respondents in the U.S. about the COVID-19 pandemic. We expected to find that, despite sometimes heated rhetoric, Americans understood, or at least didn't disagree about, the facts concerning estimates of the mortality rate and U.S. testing capacity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 What we found surprised us. We asked, for example, about the number of completed tests per million residents in the U.S. relative to Italy, one week after the White House announced its "historic public-private testing partnership" on April 13. At the time, Italy had conducted about 3,000 tests per million. Our participants were offered five options for how many tests had been completed in the U.S. per million residents. The correct answer, at the time, was between 100 and 2,000.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The participants who answered as part of a group were told that they would be rewarded if five or more in a random group of nine voted for the correct answer.Consistent with our previous work, voter responses varied with their political affiliation. More than 1 in 3 (34.2%) Republicans chose the answers most favorable to the Trump administration and claimed that the U.S. performed as many or more tests than Italy. Fewer than 1 in 7 (14.2%) Democrats did.Overall, we found a large gap in the average response provided by Democrats and Republicans who voted.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The surprise was that these percentages did not 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  much, if at all, for individuals, who were rewarded when their own answer was correct.One in 3 Republicans (33.7%) still chose the incorrect options that were most favorable to President Donald Trump, while the number of Democrats who did likewise fell a little, from 14.2%to 12.6%.Thus, unlike the patterns we observed for non-COVID-19-related questions, we found that little of the difference can be attributed to partisan expression.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We saw a similar pattern with our question regarding the COVID-19 mortality rate. Our research found that Democrats and Republicans held genuine but different beliefs, not just about values or policies, but about basic facts. To the extent that members of different parties evaluate differently the seriousness of COVID-19 and our government's response to it in their voting decisions, our results indicate that this assessment is due to differences in beliefs rather than partisan expression.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While it is tempting to attribute these results to the polarization of television and radio audiences and the influence of social media -- that is, to characterize the choices of our participants as somehow uninformed--it's worth repeating that we did not see the same partisan gaps in 2016,when we asked questions that were no less salient to partisans.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We can only speculate as to the source of these differences. It may be that the COVID-19 threat overwhelmed our usual impulse for partisan expression and that conflicting information in the earliest stages of the pandemic allowed separate narratives to take root. It also remains to be seen whether Democrats and Republicans will continue to live in these alternative realities, whether this division will extend to other issues, or what the consequences for the 2020 election will be. Until then, however, we may have to accept that some arguments among family and friends reflect the different worlds we now live in.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Last week, the Supreme Court tackled one of the country's most contentious environmental issues, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , in AEP v. Connecticut.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Without taking sides in the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  debate, a unanimous court rejected an attempt by California, New York and six other states to circumvent the authority of Congress to determine national energy policy and to force certain industries to cap their carbon dioxide emissions by judicial fiat.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Written by Clinton-appointee Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court's decision is not pro-business or anti-business, and it's surely not pro-environment or anti-environment.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rather, the case is pro-Constitution. For the Supreme Court, the case was pretty straightforward legally: it should be Congress that decides --- for better or for worse --- how the United States will respond to concerns about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , not unelected judges and juries.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The facts of the case are simple enough. Nearly 10 years ago, six states and New York City, and several environmental interest groups, sued five electric utilities with operations primarily in the Midwest and South in New York City, claiming that their legally permitted emissions were contributing to dangerous global warming and constituted a "public nuisance."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 These states sought an injunction that would require a significant reduction in the operation of the defendants' coal-fueled electric generating stations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 With a stroke of the pen, the court put an end to the states' tort claims, hopefully for good. For the court, when Congress enacted the Clean Air Act, Congress spoke on who should decide whether to regulate carbon dioxide because of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  concerns --- and it wasn't judges and juries in tort cases at the behest of tort lawyers seeking big paydays.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 According to the court, in a public nuisance suit involving 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , the trial court would be called on to determine what level of greenhouse gas emissions are "reasonable" and this would in turn entail a complex balancing of the costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The court said that judges and juries, however, are not the proper entities to resolve these complex questions. Expert agencies with power delegated to them by Congress should be the "first decider."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Many do not believe that regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, a statute that was not designed for a global issue like global 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , represents wise public policy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A bill to repeal EPA's authority in this regard passed the House of Representatives but has not been taken up by the Senate.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But whether or not regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act represents wise public policy, it remains the law of the land.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For those suggesting the court missed an opportunity to save the world, they miss the most fundamental civics lesson.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Under our Constitution, our elected representatives are charged with making policy. Earth-shattering it's not, but neither a judge nor a jury should determine energy policy in the United States.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Legally, a trial court in New York should not be permitted to manufacture a national energy policy using tort liability and nuisance law that fundamentally affects how industry in Georgia, Alabama or Florida operate.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Here the Supreme Court got it right.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 As the Last of the Millennials (or an Early Gen Z depending on the source), I've watched the "Go Out and Vote" argument from both sides of the fence. I'm someone who has decided to vote. I have scanned the room, looked at my options, and decided to give voting another chance if it means a political departure from the last four years. It feels like the only rational choice, but when I said that to my 20-yearold brother, I realized that me seeing no choice but to vote was me showing my age. My brother is someone I've jokingly dismissed as a TikTok Teen (don't tell him I said that), but I'd never question his depth of insight when it comes to the social issues of today.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He's a young Black man growing up in a media age that hasn't let him forget it. Before Trayvon Martin's death, the journey to cultural competency and wokeness was a pilgrimage. It showed introspection and a hunger for answers. Today, it's nearly a graduation requirement. That all goes to say that when my little brother comments on the state of the nation, I listen.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It wasn't long ago when he told me he was deciding on whether or not to vote. I rushed to respond "What do you mean deciding to vote? Do we have a choice at this point?" In the conversation that followed, I realized that there's a generation of people who have explored their options thoroughly and voting was barely making the list.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The voting conversation on Twitter has been an interesting back-and-forth for me. I make it known that I am not particularly enthusiastic (but privileged) to vote, but that might be endemic of my status between generations. There's an older generation of people who believe only in the privilege of voting. They cite Jim Crow, Women's Suffrage, the Voting Rights Act, and the Civil Rights Act knowledgeably and tactfully. Their cultural context is one formed around voting as hard-fought entry into a system that, despite its flaws, works. However, there's a younger generation that's resigned to vote -- and it's not because of an attitude problem. I ask that we give younger people, the ones dismissed as "the people that must not want anything to 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone " some understanding.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As we look back on the last 20-plus years that define the Gen Z political and social experience, we've seen a political system sputter and fail. We've had our highlights with the election of Barack Obama, the 44th president. However, that victory stacks against a more-dis-appointing political reality, one that a generation of young people has been conditioned to think about constantly. In their classrooms and on their social media feeds they've seen the American government fail to recognize 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , fail to protect schoolchildren from guns, fail immigrants, and ultimately fail to elect a woman (who won the popular vote). Young people aren't voting because they feel defeated -- not entitled.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 When it comes to voting, we can justifiably point a finger at the role disinformation plays. Disinformation is information that is false and deliberately created to harm a person, social group, organization, or country. In the last 5 years especially, social media tactics bent on keeping voters' eyes off the ball have been a political staple. Campaigns have been built off the frenzy a knee-jerk reaction to a sound bite can cause. However, before you cite that as what's "clouding" Gen Z's judgment, ask yourself if young people are the only ones touting half-truths on social media to explain their political allegiances.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 If the goal is to get young people to the polls, we're going to have to do a lot more than shame them. Let's start by acknowledging candidates who did stir young people into action at the polls. Consider what they offered: an abrupt departure from the status quo. Like anyone else who's known hopelessness, we have to be willing to meet Gen Z's non-voters halfway. By citing historical disenfranchisement as a reason to vote, we also have to level with current disillusionment. We have to sit down with the fact that telling young people that voting is the only choice they've got is essentially asking them to "trust us on this one." Perhaps with the right amount of patience and a willingness to engage, they might .

\f3\fs20 \cf0 A new biography of Jimmy Carter opens with a scene that summarizes the former president's tendency to envision the future while sometimes remaining tone-deaf to the present.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 As Americans lined up for fuel during the gas shortages of the summer of 1979, Carter unveiled a new addition to the White House roof: primitive solar panels.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Critics called it a stunt, "to deflect blame from the gas crisis," writes Jonathan Alter. "Carter understood this but didn't care." Carter proposed investing in clean energy, imagining a U.S. independent of Arab oil. His constituents just wanted to know when the pumps would start flowing again.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 It was perhaps the right move, but it struck the wrong note, which happened more than once in Carter's tenure. His poor timing has sometimes blinded history to the achievements of his presidency. In "His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, A Life," Alter aims to right that wrong.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "One of the things I'm trying to do in this book is revise the conventional wisdom about his presidency and post-presidency," said Alter. "The truth is, he was an underestimated president and a slightly overestimated former president, not because he didn't do some great stuff in recent years, but when you're out of power, you have fewer levers of real 
\f1\i\b \ul change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A former senior editor at Newsweek, Alter has written incisive biographies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Barack Obama. He fixed on writing about Carter, "the most misunderstood president in American history," after he discovered that Carter would certainly have addressed global warming in a second term and was the first world leader to consider the impact of carbon dioxide gases on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Alter began pursuing the project in 2015 as Donald Trump announced his candidacy with a speech calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. Alter was providing on-air commentary for MSNBC that evening.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I said on the air that this was scary. I don't think he's going to be the next president, but this poisons our politics," said Alter. "I remember thinking that Carter represents the other path in the American tradition. It sent me back with new energy to learn from a president who was honest, serious and decent."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Alter's subject has been scrutinized before, most extensively by Carter himself. Among Carter's dozens of published books are his memoirs "An Hour Before Daylight," "Keeping Faith" and "A Full Life."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Yet most accounts of Carter's life written by others had a viewpoint to support, said Alter, whether they were by members of Carter's White House team, such as aides Stuart Eizenstat and Peter Bourne, or by opponents, such as Steven Hayward.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I thought there was a gaping hole in the line of scrimmage," said Alter. "I was amazed that there had never been an independent, full-length biography."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Over the last five years Alter interviewed Carter in person six times, and six more times by email. He joined family dinners at the Carter Center, accompanied Carter at a Habitat construction project in Memphis and on a road trip to Annapolis, Maryland.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 He also had access to previously unseen private journals and to letters the young Navy officer wrote to his wife while stationed aboard the submarine USS Pomfret.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Jimmy wrote Rosalynn some of the most passionate love letters from the Navy that an American president has ever written that have been published. Nobody even knew about them before this book."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 What emerged from Alter's research was a complex figure, a deeply moral man who, at the beginning of his public life in South Georgia, failed to speak up while his neighbors at the integrated Koinonia Farm were harassed with bullets and dynamite by Sumter County racists.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Carter compensated for that failure of conscience by an extraordinary commitment to justice and human rights in the White House and beyond.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "One of the great things about Carter's life is that he used his silence of the first half of his life to power the achievements of the second half of his life," said Alter. "That's something that can be a model for us all."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Many of Carter's most significant achievements had to do with matters of conscience, writes Alter. Carter believed relinquishing ownership of the Panama Canal to Panama was the right thing to do. (And that it would also avert war.) The move was deeply unpopular in the U.S. and several legislators who supported it were voted out of office.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Carter also made enemies by insisting that the U.S. boycott Russia's 1980 Olympic Games in reprisal for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979. (He also secretly armed the Afghan mujahideen.)
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "He consistently made decisions as governor and president that were politically unpopular but farsighted and in the interest of people of Georgia and later the people of the United States," said Alter. "His wife Rosalynn was constantly saying to him, 'Can't you wait until the second term?' She was the more politically shrewd of the two."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Carter's crowning achievement was a peaceful one: convincing Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Menachem Begin of Israel to sign the Camp David agreements. "Israel and Egypt had fought each other four times in the previous 30 years," said Alter. "They haven't fired a shot in anger in the 40 years since."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 But that triumph was eclipsed by the events of 1979 and 1980. The oil crisis led to inflation of 12%, unemployment of 7% and interest rates of nearly 20%. Worst of all, when Iranian revolutionaries seized Americans in Tehran, they held Carter's final year hostage.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Because Carter didn't bring military might to bear on Iran, he was seen as weak and lost the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan. Reagan soon wrested those solar panels off the White House roof and cut the investment in alternative energy by two-thirds.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Reagan is credited with shrinking the federal government and precipitating the fall of the Soviet Union, but Alter begs to differ. He writes:
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Carter was a Democratic president, but he accomplished many things commonly associated with Ronald Reagan. It was Carter, not Reagan, who ended rampant inflation by appointing Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Carter, not Reagan, who cut the deficit and the growth rate of the federal work force; Carter, not Reagan, who first broke with the Richard Nixon-Henry Kissinger policy of detente with Moscow by inviting Soviet dissidents to the White House and building the MX missile. Contrary to his reputation, Carter ended up playing a significant role in winning the Cold War with his human rights policy and by placing intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Alter makes another point: Though it might surprise 21st century readers, Carter, the Sunday school teacher, was embraced by the rock generation. Lynyrd Skynyrd, John Denver, Jerry Jeff Walker, Jimmy Buffett and the Allman Brothers Band raised money for Carter's campaign at benefit concerts. When he was governor, Carter invited Bob Dylan to the mansion. Hunter S. Thompson was a big fan.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For that reason, Alter chose an Andy Warhol silkscreen portrait for the cover image. "I wanted to convey with that cover that there was a time when Jimmy Carter was very cool."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The fact that the U.S. did not wage war during Carter's term may seem like a pale accomplishment to modern observers, but for Carter, warfare was the final failure of the moral imagination.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A plaque given to him by former U.S. senator and Vietnam war vet Max Cleland celebrates that accomplishment with a quote from Thomas Jefferson:
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I Have the Consolation to Reflect That During the Period of My Administration Not a Drop Of the Blood of a Single Citizen Was Shed by the Sword of War."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Writes Alter, "Carter was the first president since Jefferson who could claim that distinction."

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Over the past decade, the term "Florida Man" has become an internet meme, usually referring to headlines from tabloid headlines or police blotter stories. The joke tends to single out Florida as having a disproportionate share of stumblebum criminals or just folks with bad judgment.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Tom Cooper's novel of the same name provides such examples as "Florida Man beats chess opponent with brass knuckles after losing game," and "Florida Man, coke-addled, calls 911 to ask for number for 911."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At first, Cooper's book promises the kind of lighthearted mishaps that produce "Florida Man" headlines. But as the story spans decades in South Florida, the author implies there might be more to the Florida Man than meets the eye.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some of the titular characters of "Florida Man" prove to be native sons with deep roots in the state and an appreciation of the land and its history.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Florida Man's" scope leads to some surprising and not always graceful tonal shifts. At times, Cooper seems to be playing in Carl Hiassen's sandbox, offering mystery, slapstick and chicanery in the Sunshine State. But "Florida Man" goes in different directions, as if stock characters from a scruffy comedy find themselves cast in a generational drama halfway through.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 On the South Florida coast in 1980, Reed Crowe serves as the shaggy proprietor of a seedy motel as well as the Florida Man Mystery House, a tourist trap noted for unimpressive historic artifacts and cheesy boat tours. Frequently described as "scratching his beach bum beard," Reed has good intentions but few ambitions beyond having a good time and dealing with crises that can involve sinkholes, snakes and long-lost human skulls. He's also haunted by past tragedies, one of which comes around to bite him decades later.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Reed alternates between an open feud and a wary friendship with Henry Yahchilane, a taciturn Seminole native with the habits of a hermit. Reed and Henry prove to be pillars of the community compared to Reed's old buddy Wayne Wade, an incompetent employee, substance abuser and petty criminal.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Some of the book's funniest moments involve Reed and Wayne's slovenly, corner-cutting behavior. "Wayne was known to clean his house with a leaf blower. He'd open the two side doors and let the machine rip, blasting the trash out the doors into the yard. Gum wrappers, rolling papers, cigarette packs, fast-food bags. A bizarre sight, if you were witnessing from afar. As though as storm were raging from inside the house, blowing debris outward."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The image of a home containing a whirlwind of garbage is more telling than it seems at first. Characters who seem like quirky ne'erdo-wells have deeper, darker flaws that aren't easily laughed off.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Cooper structures the book in sections, each describing a type of hurricane, beginning with
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Category
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 One." "Category Two," subtitled "Year of the Refugee," brings in two types of Cuban immigrants who offer contrasting examples of both sides of the contemporary immigration debate. Reed gives shelter to a small family of starving boat people, becoming involved with their lives and seeking to shield them from both heartless U.S. policies and black-market groups that would exploit them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Meanwhile, among the Mariel boatlift mass immigration of Cubans in 1980 was Hector "Catface" Morales, a professional assassin with a lifelong grudge against one of the book's main characters.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Horribly scarred and quick to violence, Catface is a bizarre figure reminiscent of the murderous Javier Bardem character in "No Country for Old Men." Catface seems to roam Florida killing and freebasing indiscriminately, despite being the most suspicious-looking personality imaginable.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Around its midpoint, the book becomes a straight-up action yarn with cinematic, Catface-andmouse set pieces. The bloody suspense and goofy slapstick both recede, and "Florida Man" turns unexpectedly bittersweet and meditative.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Reed and Henry both have ancestors who, respectively, helped conquer the state and suffered displacement from it. In the latter sections, Cooper takes the characters from the 1980s to the present day, capturing how development erased much of the state's oddball authenticity. Cooper shows nostalgia for "Old Florida" without being sentimental about, say, roadside zoos packed with miserable animals.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Major events include the destruction of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and a fictional but similarly menacing storm in 2019. The book's storm sequences provide not just compelling writing but underline how modern 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  could reshape the Florida coast even more than the 20th century did. Cooper's first novel, "The Marauders," showed comparable environmental concerns, following misfit treasure hunters through Louisiana bayou's fragile ecosystem in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 For the most part, Cooper's meandering narrative pays off, and readers may find themselves more emotionally invested in Reed's and Henry's lives than you'd think based on the book's early hijinks.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The author includes a two-page list of "players" in the book, which helps, given that many of the supporting roles blur together. Reed's ex-wife, for whom he continues to carry a torch, is most notable by her absence as she pursues a globetrotting art career.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Cooper's prose feels both fresh and pleasantly familiar as he describes South Florida's flora and fauna, the surf and the stars. If COVID-19 caused you to reschedule a beach trip in the summer of 2020, "Florida Man's" sure sense of place might remind you of what you missed -- and what you may continue to miss as the state keeps on

\f3\fs20 \cf0 We've reached a moment of truth for the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  debate, which is a good thing since "the truth" is what everyone has been screaming about all along.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Last week, someone released thousands of e-mails and other documents from the highly influential Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in England. I say "someone released" because it's unclear whether the deed was done by an outside hacker, an inside whistleblower or someone else.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In any case, the contents are staggering.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Now on display are the scientists' apparent attempts to manipulate 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  data to fit their narrative of an ever-warming planet. So, too, are their schemes to withhold and even delete documents sought under Freedom of Information laws, as well as to prevent contrarian researchers from publishing work in scientific journals and United Nations 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  reports.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Then there's the plainly incoherent 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  data at the heart of their work, as described by the poor computer programmer tasked with compiling it in a database upon which governments around the world depend.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 So far there have been no protests from the scientists or the university that any of the information was falsified, only laughably weak attempts to act as if none of it is terribly important.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Yet this episode obliterates the public credibility once enjoyed by these scientists. And these are not just any scientists: Their work has been integral to the reports of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and the related push for legal restrictions on carbon emissions. It is hard to imagine what they could do to re-earn such prominence and trust.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This new information is extremely timely, because next month the U.N. will meet in Copenhagen with hopes of drafting a 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  treaty that would regulate trillions of dollars worth of global commerce.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Any new treaty would be based in no small way on the work of the scientists involved in the present scandal. The only responsible option is to postpone the Copenhagen agenda while this new information is digested.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Yet as critical as the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  debate's outcome is to our future, this story has even broader significance than that. For it fits the running theme of 2009's big news stories: truth versus "trust us."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In the past year-plus, the politics of "trust us" has brought Americans bailouts for Wall Street and Detroit, a $787 billion stimulus bill, and health "reform" bills with cost estimates about which the estimators themselves are skeptical.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This is a partial list. The politics of "trust us" is wearing thin.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The trust deficit, if not the budget deficit, was supposed to be made whole once George Bush left office. Yet the Obama administration, rather than operating with the promised transparency, has been burning through public trust as fast as it has been spending real currency.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The administration's attempts to restore this trust keep falling flat. Look no further than the job-creation statistics the White House rolled out to show the stimulus was working. Journalists and bloggers doing basic fact-checking uncovered wild inflation in these figures, including hundreds of phony jobs in non-existent congressional districts.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The politics of "trust us" points to one of the most fundamental arguments for limited government. When government is involved in activities it can't account for, it is too big.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Like the East Anglia crew, it doesn't matter whether big government is intentionally deceptive or just incompetent. The result is the same: We just can't trust it.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Things to do if you like to breathe
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I grew up in Los Angeles. I remember feeling ill each year when summer approached and smog was at its worst. As part of my nurses' training, I took a pulmonary function test. The test revealed I had only 50 percent lung function. I've never been a smoker, nor did I grow up in a smoking household. The technician explained that it was most likely due to the smog I had lived in my entire life.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I have lived in Atlanta since 1997. In that time, I have seen the fights over expanding MARTA, worsening traffic and sky-high rates of asthma and allergies. We have to get serious about improving our environment. Here's what I'd like to see us do: Promote expanded public transportation to decrease traffic; promote alternatives to fossil fuels, such as solar and wind power; and place a fee on carbon that will be passed on to each consumer who can then use that money to pay for solar panels, etc. I want to breathe. Don't you? DEBRA GREENWOOD, STONE MOUNTAIN

\f3\fs20 End-of-life decision universal
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Let's discuss Grandma's care" (Opinion, Feb. 7) argues well for compassionate care for the elderly and for the responsibility of caregivers and society to provide it. As a 70-year-old whose mother died in a nursing home and whose father died in a hospital, I believe we elderly also have a responsibility to accept the inevitability of death and to talk about it with our families.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Grandma needs to discuss her own care while she still can. We elderly also need to think about what we want that care to be. Recognizing when living ends and dying begins is difficult; we will vary in our criteria. Once that threshold is crossed, however, accepting the inevitability of death means accepting the mechanism by which it comes. If it is refusal to eat or infection, there is no obligation to treat. Sometimes, allowing death is the most compassionate thing. DAVID H. LAWSON, DECATUR

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Throughout 2014, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  news thrummed in the background of front-burner crises such as Ebola and ISIS. The Pentagon called global warming an immediate security threat. The National 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Assessment said it is already doing major damage and served up a litany of calamities expected across the land. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the average global temperatures for April, May, June, August, September and October were the highest for those months on record.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In response, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution asked a dozen of the state's top elected officials and the director of the agency tasked with the state's environment whether they believe the globe is warming, and whether they think pollution caused by human activity is a cause.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The vast majority of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists agree that the answer to each of those questions is yes, although some are more emphatic than others. Skeptics ascribe the consensus to researchers' desire to keep the grant pipeline flowing.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Several officials didn't respond to repeated calls or emails from the AJC. Among those who did, some said they're not convinced the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ; others said it's not their problem; yet others said it's happening but humans aren't necessarily a cause. None voiced acceptance of proposed federal mandates that would reduce the nation's output of greenhouse gasses.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The AJC's two questions went unanswered by the office of Georgia's U.S. Senator-elect David Perdue. During his election campaign, Perdue made reference in a press release to what he called his opponent's "job-killing" stance "to 'act now' on 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Sen. Johnny Isakson didn't directly address the questions but said in a statement that the U.S. should reduce emissions, adding that that's why he supports nuclear energy. "I also believe it is in our nation's geopolitical and security interests to develop reduced emissions technologies so that we stop purchasing energy from dictatorial regimes such as Iran and Venezuela that seek to do us harm," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 'Definitely NOT settled'
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 In the U.S. House, Georgia is losing its two representatives on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Republican Phil Gingrey gave up his seat to run unsuccessfully for the Senate seat eventually won by Perdue. He will be replaced by Republican Barry Loudermilk. And Democratic incumbent John Barrow lost to Republican Rick Allen.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Allen vehemently rejected the idea that warming is an established fact. "The science is definitely NOT settled," he said in an email. "Limiting debate to one side is not the same as being conclusive. ...
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I am not convinced and I am certainly not ready to destroy jobs and whole industry sectors in order to tax industries liberals don't like and send the money to sectors that they do like."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Loudermilk struck similar themes. "I believe that 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is a function of nature; the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  has been 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  as long as the Earth has existed," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We absolutely should be good stewards of the planet, and I am very much opposed to reckless pollution and disregard for the environment, but I also know that some politicians and bureaucrats believe in whatever theory gives them an opportunity to take money from the energy sector and spend it themselves in the name of saving the planet."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 At the state level, Georgia's top official deferred to leaders in Washington. "This is more of a national and international policy issue," said Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Gov. Nathan Deal, who appoints the board responsible for Georgia's environmental stewardship. "Not one where we should or would weigh in."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Consistent with that reticence, in September Deal passed on an opportunity to criticize the EPA's current effort to curb power plant emissions. Fifteen Republican governors signed a letter criticizing proposed carbon emissions limits, but Deal was not among them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The Department of Natural Resources' chairman, Philip A. Wilheit Jr., and the director of the DNR's Environmental Protection Division, Judson Turner, did not return calls from the AJC on the subject of 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Neither did the chairman of the Public Service Commission, Chuck Eaton, which oversees much of the work of the state's energy utilities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, a Republican from Blue Ridge, provided a written statement.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "While some are eager to proclaim that human-caused 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is 'settled science,' there are many others who remain skeptical," Ralston's statement read. "Claiming that the debate is over helps advance a particular agenda and disregards the fact that the only provable result of policies proposed as a result is the export of American jobs to countries with abysmal environmental practices."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 'Humans are contributing'
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 To support his view, Ralston cited Dr. Judith Curry of Georgia Tech. Curry believes the Earth is warming --- except for a current "pause" --- and told the AJC in an interview that, among scientists, "everybody agrees that humans are contributing to warming." However, she chastises other 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists for overstating how much humans are to blame and the certainty of likely consequences.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Jack Murphy, a Republican from Cumming, who chairs the Senate Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee and sits on the powerful Rules and Appropriations committees, was skeptical that global temperatures are rising.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I still haven't seen anything that's positive proof," Murphy said. "Until I do, I'm going to have to say, well, if it is 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , it's 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  at such a minute stage that I don't know what the long term effects are going to be."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Among the utilities overseen by the panel Murphy chairs are Georgia Power and its parent company, Southern Company, which feel the pinch when the government tightens pollution rules. They, their political committees and their employees donated more than $115,000 to Gov. Deal, Speaker Ralston and Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle in the last four years.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Georgia Power and its employee PAC gave to politicians and parties alike, with at least $60,000 going to the Republican Party in the 2014 cycle, at least $10,000 to the Georgia House Republican Trust, and at least $10,000 to the Democratic Party. (The companies are not solely reliant on fossil fuels; they recently made a push into solar, spurred by the Public Service Commission.)
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Politicians say they are not influenced by donations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I'm not even sure what the connection between donations and 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  would be," Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Deal, wrote in an email.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Cagle would not plant his flag in the warming camp, but said he could still support sound environmental policies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "While scientist(s) will argue over this issue, it does appear that the earth goes through warming and cooling cycles," Cagle said in a statement provided through a spokesman. "I will leave it to scientific experts to determine what the causes of those 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  are, but either way we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of the creation with which we have been entrusted."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 'Not a scientist'
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I-am-not-a-scientist was a popular refrain.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "You know, I'm not a scientist," said Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Steve Gooch. "So I have to base my decision making on information that I get from other people, so I guess it's hard for me to say for sure."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 However, he added, "I think we have a duty as citizens to protect Mother Earth and try to pass it on to our next generation as good as or better than we found it." He thinks we're on the right course to do that, he said, without federal interference.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 His counterpart in the House, Transportation Chairman Jay Roberts, a Republican from Ocilla, was on the same page.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "First of all, naturally, I'm not a scientist, but in my opinion we're going through cycles like we have throughout history," Roberts said. He recalled in his own childhood winter holidays much warmer than those now. If so many 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists say the Earth is warming overall, he said, that may be because they know that's how they'll keep getting money for research.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The chair of the House Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee, Don Parsons, a Republican from Marietta, also remains unconvinced. "As far as global warming, I have read so many different things, so many different reports from different scientific studies that come to different conclusions, I don't know," Parsons said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "I'm not one of those people who just sits and rejects the idea, but I'm just not convinced."
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 AJC data specialist Jeff Ernsthausen contributed to this article.

\f3\fs20 Georgia Tech prof cited by 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  skeptics
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Among 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  scientists, one often held up as a dissenter on global warming is right here at Georgia Tech: Earth Sciences Professor Judith Curry.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 One science magazine even dubbed her a "
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  heretic." But look carefully at her statements --- including some quoted by GOP politicians --- and Curry, too, believes the Earth is warming, and that human activity is a cause.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "Everybody agrees that humans are contributing to warming," Curry said in an interview with the AJC.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 That said, she does differ in important ways with scientists who urge immediate action to counteract the Earth's warming trend. She thinks the earth is warming at a slower rate than computer models predict, and she's not at all sure that man-made pollution is the primary cause. She differs with many of her colleagues on the meaning of a current pause in surface temperature warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 She thinks fostering new energy technologies to replace fossil fuels is wise, but that weaning us from carbon-based fuels is a project for the long term. Most jarring for her colleagues, she doesn't think 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is an emergency.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 DEBATE
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Format, moderator were biggest losers
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Much has been said about who "won" the first presidential debate of 2012. Clearly, President Obama should have been more aggressive concerning Mitt Romney, who was acting like the schoolyard bully he is. However, the biggest "loser" was the format, as well as the moderator.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The format was nothing more than a bar-room argument without any rules or controls. Mr. Lehrer didn't control the debate at all, and that is why the debate was nothing more than an argument between a schoolyard bully, and one too detached. Debates must have structure, procedure and rules to show who has the best argument.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Faithful called to be stewards of Creation
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The weather is our nation's favorite topic for small talk, and there's been plenty to discuss in this year of record-setting temperatures, wildfires, drought and storms. Yet when it comes to talking about the larger, long-term implications of the weather (that is, 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone ), our leaders shy away from the issue.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A recent poll by the Yale University Project on 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate Change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  Communication found that 61 percent of undecided voters said they see global warming as an "important issue." Yet, during the recent presidential debate on domestic policy, this topic was not mentioned.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Politicians may shy away from talking about 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , but as people of faith, we cannot be silent. The member congregations of Georgia Interfaith Power & Light recognize that God calls us to be good stewards of Creation, and to care for our neighbors. 
\f1\i\b \ul Climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  is a moral issue. We can't ignore the growing reality of weather havoc, and we owe it to our kids to act now for their future.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rather than arguing choices between good jobs and cleaner energy, we should celebrate that Americans have the ingenuity to successfully address the challenges of our 
\f1\i\b \ul changing

\f3\fs20 DROUGHT
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Recent rainy days need some love, too
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Why do local Atlanta radio and t.v. weather forecasters invariably describe dry, sunny days as a "10" on their scales, and give rainy days a much lower mark of quality? Certainly, they're aware of the awful drought of 2012, and in fact, they usually remark on how many inches of rainfall we're below average.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This year, as millions of Georgians (especially those in any agricultural industry) can attest, lack of adequate rainfall is a hurtful thing. The best weather days are like those we experienced recently - when it rained for about 24 hours continuously.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Two shareholder proposals urging Southern Co. to disclose how it could be affected by global warming won significant support from some big pension plans and other investors at the utility's annual shareholder meeting this week.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Neither resolution passed, but one garnered about one-third of shareholder votes and the other got about 29 percent, according to the groups supporting the resolutions. Those vote totals are higher than outsiders' proposals typically get without management's support.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The two shareholder proposals, backed by a mix of environmental activists, pension funds and other investors, asked for the Atlanta-based utility to tell investors how it will operate and how much it will cost if tighter limits on greenhouse gases go into effect.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The shareholder votes "sent Southern Company's board and management a strong message," the sponsors of the resolutions said in a joint press release, to reduce the company's risk of having to close down coal-fired power plants or to make other 
\f1\i\b \ul changes
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  to deal with the threat of global warming.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Calls for so-called 
\f1\i\b \ul climate-change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  "stress tests" are trendy at utility and energy company shareholder meetings this year. They also got significant backing, though not a majority, at Exxon and Chevron meetings.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Southern spokesman Tim Leljedal declined to say whether the utility will make the future disclosures requested. He said the company is "actively developing" power plants that produce "carbon-free" power, including solar power farms and an expansion of the Vogtle nuclear plant near Augusta.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Southern Co. had asked shareholders to vote against both non-binding proposals. The company said it already discloses much of the requested information to investors or in regulatory filings.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The resolutions were submitted by As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy group, and the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment, a group of religious institutions. But they also won backing from two of the nation's largest public employee pensions in California and New York.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 "We supportthe(proposal) asking the company to report on the risks associated with 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  through routine annual disclosures," said California's largest public employee pension, CalPERS, in a recent filing. The pension owns about 2.6 percent of Southerns' shares.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 Lost in the growing 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  debate is an understanding about what the policy options will mean for the 504,000 people like me who manage forest land in the state of Georgia. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Since privately owned forests make up two-thirds of all forests in the U.S., with 14.3 million acres in this state alone, what happens on this land is of urgent concern.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Healthy forests absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and have the potential to offset excess emissions elsewhere.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 A full 10 percent of all carbon emissions in the U.S. every year are absorbed by forests and forest products, and they could do even more, up to 20 percent, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, if the right incentives were put in place.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Healthy forests also supply us with clean, renewable energy that, if used to replace fossil fuels, also reduces carbon emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Rep. John Barrow (D-Ga.) is to be credited for speaking up on behalf of Georgia forest owners and helping make sure the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  bill reported out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee does allow some private U.S. forests to be recognized and supported as a source of biomass for renewable energy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 This is a good start, but the bill must do even more to ensure private forest owners can help us reach our nation's 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and energy goals.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Besides their biomass potential, private forests can also serve as a "carbon offset" under a cap and trade system that allows forest owners to sell their enhanced carbon storage to an emitter, thereby reducing emissions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 While carbon trading is important, more is needed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Smaller forest landowners in the U.S. may not be able to participate because the set-up costs for trading carbon are just too expensive for lot sizes of less than 100 acres.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 Yet together these smaller forests make up 119 million acres --- that's almost the size of all the pasture land in the U.S.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 We could immediately put these lands to work in helping combat 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone , but Congress must adjust the bill to provide supplemental incentives (the carbon reduced would supplement the reductions achieved via cap and trade) for forest management practices that enhance carbon storage. Such practices include replanting trees, 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  timber rotations and avoiding deforestation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 There are 10 million family forest owners like me who want to do their part to address 
\f1\i\b \ul climate change
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Creating a modest revenue stream for carbon-enhancing forest activities is the key.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 When a developer comes knocking, and a forest owner is facing 30-year lows on timber prices, it helps to have an economic incentive that can nudge that owner toward taking the step that helps 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  and protects forests.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 And besides the 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  benefits, conservation brings the other forest benefits we cherish --- clean air, safe drinking water, wildlife and recreation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 I hope that Georgians and folks all over the country will support keeping land in families and families on the land which will help us to attain the environmental goals we all seek.

\f3\fs20 \cf0 West's wildfires long studied and even predicted
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 The late Stephen Schneider put forward some possible future scenarios in his 1989 book, "Global Warming." He wrote that California's biggest concern would be "the frequent episodes of smoky sky a constant reminder of the growing intensity and scale of wildfires," with early dry seasons and hot summers increasing the fire potential. Recent days and years have proved Schneider correct. Present-day studies from Stanford University confirm the growing risk of large, rapidly growing wildfires as a result of a warming 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone . Both Schneider and modern studies acknowledge the adverse effect of improper land-use management, but it is widely accepted the 
\f1\i\b \ul changing
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  plays a major role in exacerbating these deadly and costly disasters. Recently, Forbes magazine asked, "Is anybody listening? How much longer will we continue to ignore the impact of our continued refusal to do anything to mitigate the planet's long-standing 
\f1\i\b \ul climate
\f3\i0\b0 \ulnone  emergency?" Dr. Schneider would undoubtedly agree with everyone's frustration.

\f3\fs20 AJC overdoing incessant COVID-19 news coverage
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 What used to be a morning pleasure is now just miserable! Back then, I could start each morning with the digital AJC on my iPad and a large cup of black coffee and methodically work my way from the headlines on Page 1 to the ads at the end. Now it's COVID-19 in the A section, COVID-19 in Metro, Sports has COVID-19 testing of a sports team, followed by Living, which now means -- according to the AJC -- Living with COVID-19. Enough! Georgia has had 6,000 deaths supposedly from COVID-19 out of a population base of 11 million. That's a death rate of about 0.05%of that total population. That means a survival rate of 99.95% of the Georgia population. All the AJC is doing is running a campaign to destroy the confidence of Georgians and convince all that they're going to die. Enough, and shame on you!
