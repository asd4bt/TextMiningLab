As we enter the final month leading up to the 2020 presidential election, the nationâ??s attention has been drawn to a series of pre-election debates. Climate change was a hotly discussed topic during the October 7th Vice Presidential Debate between Kamala Harris and Mike Pence, with both sides claiming that they were backing â??science.â?? However, the messages they were taking from the science were significantly different. While Harris supports a version of the sweeping Green New Deal, Pence prefers to protect the environment through protecting the economy and exploring alternative fossil fuels such as natural gas. How can two campaigns each look at the same scientific â??factsâ?? and draw such vastly different conclusions?
 It turns out, a lot of the disagreements are not about the facts at all, but over how drastic the impacts of climate change are expected to be. The Trump Administrationâ??s analysis of the science of global warming is that the health of the economy poses a much more potent risk than the unknowns of climate change. However, the fact that the consequences of climate change are often unpredictable should lead to more concern, not less â?" as accurate as global warming models have become, there will likely be impacts that nobody could have predicted. The economy is famously bad at responding to unpredictable catastrophes; protecting the global climate now will in turn protect the economy in the future. But just how drastic are the consequences of climate change expected to be? Drastic enough to justify the $2 trillion modified Green New Deal that the Biden campaign is proposing? To answer this, letâ??s dive into what the climate change models expect the impact of global climate change to be on northern Illinois (including Lake County). The EPA reported in 2016 ¹ that on average, temperatures in Illinois have already increased by one degree Fahrenheit over the past century. However, the most drastic changes are likely to come from precipitation patterns: the bulk of rainfall is going to shift from the summer to the spring, and be more consolidated into heavy rainstorms. One significant impact of this will be the flooding of local watersheds; to read more about how this will impact the Des Plaines River and Libertyville, you can read my blog on â??the Des Plaines Riverâ??s Flooding Problemâ? at https://marclos.github.io/Climate_Change_Narratives/F2020/Burns.html. Illinoisâ?? agricultural economy is particularly vulnerable to the double whammy of rain shifts and temperature change. Hatfield (2014) ² describes how earlier rainfall will impact planting times, and more frequent rainstorms and high summer heat risks damaging crops. Even short term exposure to these sorts of stressors result on average in a 15-20% loss in crop yield, which would have a significant impact on Illinoisâ?? $84 billion annual agriculture industry. As a highly agricultural economy, Illinois clearly has a lot to lose if climate change is allowed to continue unabated. By implementing green infrastructure today â?" such as through a Green New Deal, costly as it is â?" regions such as Illinois can avoid significant economic ramifications of global warming in the future. It just makes good sense. 1 Environmental Protection Agency. (2016). â??What climate change means for Illinois.â?

GENEVA - In the wake of heat waves, global warming, forest fires, storms, droughts and a rising number of hurricanes, the U.N. weather agency warned Tuesday that the number of people who need international humanitarian help could rise 50% by 2030 compared to the 108 million who needed it worldwide in 2018. In a new report released with partners, the World Meteorological Agency says more disasters attributed to weather are taking place each year. It said over 11,000 disasters have been attributed to weather, climate and phenomena like tsunamis that are related to water over the last 50 years - causing 2 million deaths and racking up $3.6 trillion worth of economic costs. In one hopeful development over that period, the average number of deaths from each separate weather disaster per year has dropped by one-third, even as the number of such events and the economic costs from them have both surged. 
The 2020 State of Climate Services report, compiled by 16 international agencies and financing institutions, calls on governments to put more money into early-warning systems that can improve countries' ability to prepare for, respond to and mitigate the impact of such natural disasters. "While COVID-19 generated a large international health and economic crisis from which it will take years to recover, it is crucial to remember that climate change will continue to pose an on-going and increasing threat to human lives, ecosystems, economies and societies for centuries to come," said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. "Recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to move forward along a more sustainable path towards resilience and adaptation in the light of anthropogenic climate change," he said. Taalas, responding to a question from China's CCTV network at a news conference, also hailed a "great" announcement from Chinese President Xi Jinping last month that his country plans to become carbon-neutral by 2060. Taalas noted investments in renewable energy programs like solar and wind in China, the source of one-fourth of global carbon emissions - largely due to coal-fired power plants. While praising the U.S. private sector for its efforts to fight climate change, Taalas also expressed hope the U.S. government - which under the Trump administration has rejected the 2015 Paris climate accord - to come on board. He noted the "common vision" between China and many European Union countries on the issue. The European bloc wants to become carbon-neutral by 2050, though not all member states agree on how to achieve that target. "I hope that also the USA will join that club in the near future," he said.

Lake County restoration project to see if native grasses are key to dealing with climate change

Restoring landscapes to their native state is a regular practice for the Lake County Forest Preserve District, but a pending project at Grant Woods in Ingleside has the added aspect of climate change as a key element. In late October or early November, more than 800 pounds of native grass seed will be sown over 180 acres of what had been rolling agricultural fields east of Route 59 and north of Monaville Road. Two thirds of the land will be sown with seed "sourced" farther south than normally would be the case to determine whether it will be a better choice for future restorations as climate change progresses. "We know that by 2050, our climate is predicted to be more like Oklahoma," said Pati Vitt, manager of restoration ecology for the forest preserve district and originator of the "Growing Through Change" project. 
"This is more what I consider a demonstration project to see how we are sourcing seeds," Vitt added. "Should we be sourcing farther south and if so, how much farther south?" Along with the grasses, sedges will be planted in wetland areas on the site. Flowering plants will follow in fall 2021. The area is one part of an ongoing restoration at Grant Woods, which covers 1,226 acres. The broader effort has been facilitated by donations of more than $1.1 million to the Preservation Foundation of the Lake County Forest Preserves by a couple with long, personal ties to the land but who wish to remain anonymous, according to Rebekah Snyder, executive director. Some of that money, along with a $216,000 grant from the national Wildlife Conservation Society Climate Adaptation Fund, will be used for the $350,000 farmland restoration. "It's not just putting native seed on this agricultural parcel," Snyder said. "What we wanted to do was take a climate change model and put it on top of that." Vitt, who came to the forest district nearly two years ago, had been curator of the seed bank collection at the Chicago Botanic Garden. She's been considering the effects of climate change on native plant populations and seeds being used for 15 years or more. The restoration community long has grappled with this complex issue, and the Grant Woods project presents an opportunity to compare a new strategy with standard practice to determine what might work best going forward, according to Vitt. "This is a highly different approach," she said. "The concern might be if we don't keep up with that quickly changing climate, we could find in 20 years the plants in our natural areas aren't producing well enough." Because many species of pollinators respond to temperature, while plants respond to the length of the daylight, the two could get out of sync as the average temperature increases, according to Vitt. The district will monitor how the southern grasses survive, grow and reproduce, and whether their use will be more successful than standard strategies. "We can grow most anything but will it handle the new climate that's coming?" said Ken Klick, the forest district's site ecologist for Grant Woods. "Plants from farther south may be favored in this changing climate in the future," he added. "Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas - those would be the areas we're pinpointing," for grass seed. While climate models appear to be accurate in projecting what the changes will be, timing is less certain, Vitt said. That means the project runs the risk of sourcing too far south for current conditions. "We simply don't know," she said. "There have been few, if any, demonstration projects at this scale to explore this." Vitt says the research is needed to protect plant vitality and protect native ecosystems, and also provide fresh "marketplace opportunities" for retailers and consumers. It also could become a key seed source for other entities in the future, Klick noted. "This may be one of the most valuable restorations in the region 50 years from now," he said.

Rivals believe climate change is real, but their solutions differ

Both candidates for Illinois' 14th Congressional District seat believe mankind is contributing to global climate change - but their solutions differ. For incumbent Democrat Lauren Underwood of Naperville, acknowledging what many scientific experts and politicians have been saying for years about humanity's impact on the planet falls in line with her party's view. For Republican challenger Jim Oberweis of Sugar Grove, that stance breaks from many in the GOP. Underwood and Oberweis talked about climate change and other issues in questionnaires for the Daily Herald and other interviews. 
Scientists with NASA and other organizations have observed that Earth's surface temperature is rising more quickly than expected. As a result, scientists say, significant changes to the environment are occurring. Sea levels are rising, glaciers are shrinking, ice is melting at a faster rate than usual in Greenland and on the polar continents, and increased drought and insect infestations are leading to more wildfires. Flooding and coastal erosion have worsened, too, including in the Chicago area. Underwood, who is seeking a second term in the Nov. 3 election, blamed climate change on human activity "and our reliance on fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases." She cited the extreme weather and "unprecedented" flooding that have affected northern Illinois in recent years as examples of its impact. "(It) has caused millions of dollars in damage to businesses, homes, farms and infrastructure," Underwood said. Underwood said farmers in the 14th District can't afford for the nation to ignore climate change. She said they're why she proposed eventually successful legislation that prevents the U.S. Agriculture Department and other federal agencies from removing information about climate change from their websites and official communications. "I believe public policy should be driven by science and data," she said. In the House, Underwood helped secure federal funding to support state and local efforts to plan for public health threats caused by climate change. Underwood also said she supports a bill introduced in the House last year that would, if made law, establish requirements to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and result in an economy that's free of such emissions or offsets them by 2050. "Smart investments in clean energy infrastructure will bring high-quality green jobs to our community and will make northern Illinois a leader in this sector," Underwood said. Oberweis' view on climate change has evolved. When asked about it during his unsuccessful 2014 run for the U.S. Senate, Oberweis said Chicago's arctic winter temperatures called into question research on global warming. He said more evidence was needed "before we destroy the economy with huge regulations." In this campaign, however, Oberweis said he believes climate change is real and that humanity contributes to it. He said "common-sense solutions" are needed. Oberweis called the Green New Deal - an environmental proposal from Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York - "far too radical." He supports transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy but noted "it is not something that is going to happen overnight." "We must work toward these goals with the objective of maintaining accessibility to affordable energy," said Oberweis, a dairy owner who has served in the state Senate since 2013. Oberweis said technological innovations are bringing down the cost of renewable energy products and making them increasingly competitive. But the nation isn't yet ready to make the wind and sun the dominant sources of energy, he said. Nuclear energy should be part of the nation's long-term energy solution, Oberweis added. The 14th District includes parts of DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will, DeKalb and Kendall counties. * For more election coverage and help filling out your ballot, visit dailyherald.com/election.

Casten, Ives spar over COVID-19 relief, climate change in debate The Democratic and Republican candidates for Illinois' 6th Congressional District seat argued about COVID-19 relief efforts, climate change and other issues over the weekend in their only televised debate. Incumbent Democrat Sean Casten of Downers Grove and Republican challenger Jeanne Ives of Wheaton agreed on little during the nearly hourlong session, which aired Friday night on WGN-TV. Long-delayed financial relief for the people and businesses struggling during the pandemic was the first issue discussed. The House has passed several new relief packages since the initial ones in March, but none have been debated by the Senate or signed into law by President Donald Trump. 
Ives argued that too much money in the relief proposals would go to projects "completely unrelated to COVID relief." She also criticized what she called "massive bailouts for people" and noted that many industries have been deeply affected by the crisis. "Are we going to bail out all of them?" asked Ives, a former state legislator who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018. "Or are we going to open up the market (and) let our private sector figure this out?" Casten, who is seeking a second term, called the coronavirus crisis "avoidable" and said it happened because "we've politicized science." The first relief bill bought the nation "six months of runway" that Trump has exhausted, said Casten, the former CEO of an energy recycling company. Testing and contact tracing are needed, he said. In response, Ives said Democrats want to keep the economy shut down and noted that other states have allowed schools and businesses to reopen. Casten was given the last word and said coronavirus cases are spiking in Wisconsin and other states where people "are not following public health measures." He pleaded that the governmental response to the issue "cannot be partisan." Later, when asked if Congress should make a law mandating people wear masks to stop the spread of the virus, Casten pointed to the success of nations with mask mandates in beating the virus. "We know what has to be done," Casten said. "We just have to defer to the experts and make sure we put facts and science first." On the other hand, Ives called such a mandate "outrageous" and supported the right of people to make their own decisions. "You are telling adults how to live their lives," she said. Additionally, Ives denied there's "definitive proof" masks prevent spread of the virus "in every situation." When asked about his support for stricter gun laws and a national gun buyback program, Casten expressed amazement about the recently uncovered plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, as well as the heavily armed protesters who occupied the Michigan Capitol in May. "In what other country in the world would somebody show up in the statehouse with guns and we wouldn't say these are either terrorists or the beginning of a military coup," he said. "Somehow we've accepted that as being American. Part of why that happens is because we live in a country with more guns than people." Ives said the U.S. needs to enforce gun laws already on the books. Casten and Ives also disagreed on whether climate change is man-made. Ives said mankind isn't to blame as much as factors "in the solar system" and in the oceans, as well as volcanic activity. Casten said the science pointing to man-made climate change is clear. "That's like not believing in gravity," Casten said of Ives' stance. "It's still real." Rare agreement between the candidates came when both Casten and Ives said they support people voting by mail or any other available option. Both also opposed movements to defund police departments. A video of the debate can be viewed at wgntv.com/news/watch-live-6th-congressional-district-debate-between-sea n-casten-jeanne-ives. Libertarian candidate Bill Redpath of West Dundee also is running in the Nov. 3 election. He did not participate in the debate. The 6th District includes parts of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry counties.

The candidates for Illinois' 11th Congressional District seat have disparate opinions about climate change. Incumbent Democrat Bill Foster of Naperville believes mankind primarily is responsible for changes to the global climate, while Republican challenger Rick Laib of Joliet doubts humans are to blame. The candidates talked about climate change and other issues with the Daily Herald ahead of the Nov. 
3 election. Scientists with NASA and other organizations have observed that Earth's surface temperature is rising more quickly than expected. As a result, scientists say, significant changes to the environment are occurring. Sea levels are rising, glaciers are shrinking, ice is melting at a faster rate than usual in Greenland and on the polar continents and increased drought and insect infestations have led to more wildfires. Flooding and coastal erosion has worsened, too, including in the Chicago area. Not everyone agrees that the climate is changing or that man's burning of fossil fuels for energy - thus increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - is responsible. Foster, a former particle physicist seeking his sixth full term in Congress, insists climate change is real and largely man-made. He called it "one of the most serious challenges we face." "It is a real threat to our children's future and our world's natural beauty and resources," Foster said. "If we fail to act, we will lose many of the landmarks and natural beauty that make this world so wonderful." To address the issue, Foster said the U.S. should spend more to research ways to lower the costs of reliable, sustainable and clean energy. As an example, he said decades of federally funded research at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont and elsewhere has resulted in batteries that cost less and perform better. "As a result, in the next few years, the total cost of ownership of electric cars will be lower than gasoline-powered cars," Foster said. "When this price crossover takes place, we will no longer need to be arguing about (fuel economy) standards since nobody will want to buy a fossil fuel powered car." Foster predicts that technology will adopted worldwide and dramatically lower humanity's carbon footprint. Laib, a Will County sheriff's deputy making his first run for Congress, said he is not convinced that climate change is caused by human activity. The arguments, he said, "are not conclusive." "There is an absence of consensus among industry experts as to the threat of climate change," Laib said. Still Laib said he is "open to the arguments." Laib said private industries have developed technologies that can help care for the planet. The U.S. government should reduce taxes to encourage private companies to continue developing such technologies, he said. The 11th District includes parts of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall and Will counties.

Later, when asked if Congress should make a law mandating people wear masks to stop the spread of the virus, Casten pointed to the success of nations with mask mandates in beating the virus. "We know what has to be done," Casten said. "We just have to defer to the experts and make sure we put facts and science first." On the other hand, Ives called such a mandate "outrageous" and supported the right of people to make their own decisions. "You are telling adults how to live their lives," she said. Additionally, Ives denied there's "definitive proof" masks prevent spread of the virus "in every situation." When asked about his support for stricter gun laws and a national gun buyback program, Casten expressed amazement about the recently uncovered plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, as well as the heavily armed protesters who occupied the Michigan Capitol in May. "In what other country in the world would somebody show up in the statehouse with guns and we wouldn't say these are either terrorists or the beginning of a military coup," he said. "Somehow we've accepted that as being American. Part of why that happens is because we live in a country with more guns than people." Ives said the U.S. needs to enforce gun laws already on the books. Casten and Ives also disagreed on whether climate change is man-made. Ives said mankind isn't to blame as much as factors "in the solar system" and in the oceans, as well as volcanic activity. Casten said the science pointing to man-made climate change is clear. "That's like not believing in gravity," Casten said of Ives' stance. "It's still real." Rare agreement between the candidates came when both Casten and Ives said they support people voting by mail or any other available option. Both also opposed movements to defund police departments.

Libertarian candidate Bill Redpath of West Dundee also is running in the Nov. 3 election. He did not participate in the debate. The 6th District includes parts of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry counties.

Peggy Notebaert museum exhibit drives home climate change
Climate change can be hard for people to understand because humans are adaptable. But other life-forms aren't so lucky.
"We don't have to shiver or pant, we can just change the AC," said Steve Sullivan, senior curator of urban ecology for the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. "Other species can't do that. Change from a biological standpoint is impossible for most organisms. If this summer is half a degree warmer, climatologists are going to freak out but homeowners won't notice a difference."
The museum is helping to educate visitors on the causes and effects of climate change, and how they can help, through the exhibit "Weather to Climate: Our Changing World," which runs in Chicago through Oct. 23 before heading out on tour.
"Climate change is really the defining issue of our time, and we saw that as an issue that we as an institution could address," Sullivan said. "We also noticed that a lot of museums rent traveling exhibits that address pressing issues, but oddly there are no really good, moderately sized traveling exhibits on climate change."
The exhibit opens by explaining the difference between weather and climate, letting kids play dress up in front of a mirror to see how their clothes may change frequently, like the weather. But climate - like a person's wardrobe - is typically consistent over time, depending on where you live. Residents of Hawaii, for example, might wear heavy jackets on occasion, but their overall wardrobe will be lighter than if they lived in Chicago.
"If you look at the political debate, a lot of times we conflate weather and climate," Sullivan said. "The weather you are experiencing at this moment is a data point. It's really kind of irrelevant. That collection of data points that are studied over 30 years equals a meaningful climate data point. When we look at that overall picture, not just what's happening today or yesterday, is when we can really see what's going on."
Kids can also take on the role of a meteorologist, donning suit jackets, standing in front of a green screen in a mock television studio and reading weather reports off a teleprompter while they see themselves amid graphics.
"At the most superficial level you're just interacting with this goofy, fun thing and seeing pictures of weather," Sullivan said. "At the most sophisticated level the text is informing the audience of how weather and climate are changing and how this affects people."
The middle section of the exhibit addresses the effects of climate change using mounted specimens of red and gray squirrels as an example.
Kids can also spin a wheel of fortune showing different animals and weather conditions they could be exposed to. A video then explains the potential effects. For instance the pika, a miniature rabbit with short ears, lives in high elevations and wouldn't mind colder temperatures. But pikas - who spend cold months eating stores of hay - would not get enough food to survive the winter if it was too wet.
"These specific plants and animals are adapted to specific climactic regimes," Sullivan said. "As those climates change, those animals may be able to adapt, they may be able to move. But most things that have to adapt to change in the world simply go extinct."
The exhibit ends by exploring how humans are impacting climate change. A sculpture incorporates 94 balls, each filled with a cubic foot of air to represent the amount of carbon dioxide the average American puts out in a day through the burning of fossil fuels.
By following tips for reducing their carbon footprint, visitors can help prevent climate change from getting worse.
"We want to end on a note that empowers people and, importantly, we want to end on a positive note that makes them feel like they can make a difference," Sullivan said.

I'm having a hard time coping with scary climate change news. What should I do?

I'm having a hard time coping with scary climate change news. What should I do? Dear Sara: I recently read the climate change report out of Australia - "Existential climate-related security risk: A scenario approach" - and I am having a hard time coping with its implications. I'm in my late 20s, I work for a consulting group that helps companies switch to clean energy sources, and I am typically an optimistic person. I know that our world is not in a good place, but I have always been hopeful that by working together we will find a way to fix it. 
After reading this piece, though, I do not know what to do. Assuming it's true that human civilization as we know it could very likely come to an end by 2050, it's hard to focus on staying positive. How can we fight against the economic and political systems in place in the U.S. so that we get results, instead of feeling resigned to the way things are now? How do we stay positive here? I'm not sure if that's a question or a cry for help, but I hope there is a good question in there. - Courtney in New York City Dear Courtney, My answer might seem contradictory at first, so bear with me. I don't find that Australian report very credible. But I also think you're right to fear for the future. And it's worth taking steps to address that feeling - more on that in a bit. About that Australian climate change report For readers who missed it, in May 2019, an Australian think tank published an 11-page paper by former fossil fuel executive Ian Dunlop and book author David Spratt. In their paper, Dunlop and Spratt outline a scenario in which the world does not swiftly reduce global warming pollution. By 2050, in their scenario, coral reefs and the Amazon ecosystem collapse, deadly heat displaces more than 1 billion people, and food prices skyrocket. Dire social consequences ensue, including armed conflict, pandemics, and outright chaos. The paper, which was not peer-reviewed, provoked immediate criticism from climate scientists, who challenged both the report and resulting news articles claiming that human civilization could end within 30 years. "This is a classic case of a media article overstating the conclusions and significance of a non-peer-reviewed report that itself had already overstated (and indeed misrepresented) peer-reviewed science," climate scientist Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre, wrote in a critique of a news article on the paper. "(T) he report's authors have merely read (or possibly seen without actually reading) a few of the scariest papers they could find, misunderstood (or not read properly) at least one of them, and presented unjustified statements," Betts said. Penn State scientist Michael Mann - who has endured intense harassment over his work on climate change - also called the think tank report exaggerated. "I respect the authors and appreciate that their intentions are good, but as I have written before, overblown rhetoric, exaggeration, and unsupportable doomist framing can be counteractive to climate action," he told NewScientist. You can read more about the controversy over the Australian paper in this Vox explainer: "Is climate change an 'existential threat' - or just a catastrophic one?" The case for worrying about the climate Even if you don't buy the idea that civilization is going to outright collapse, there is plenty of mainstream, peer-reviewed research indicating that climate change is likely to cause enormous suffering this century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the organization of scientists that issues periodic reports on climate science, is sometimes accused of being too conservative in its assessments. But even a recent IPCC report warns that an additional 0.5 degree Celsius of warming - on top of the roughly 1 degree the world has already warmed - could kill 70-90% of the world's coral reefs, cause annual global fish catches to fall by 1.5 million tons, and increase the risks to "health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth." And according to the IPCC, warming the planet by an additional 0.5 degree C is actually the best-case scenario. Unless the world cuts global warming pollution swiftly - by about 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050 - the planet is likely to warm by more than 0.5 degree C, unleashing even more harm to people and the global community of species. Yikes! Courtney, you asked how to stay positive in light of frightening information about the climate. What if you ? didn't? What would happen if you allowed yourself to feel the full force of your fear, sorrow, anger, or despair? "Respect and honor your feelings," said Margaret Klein Salamon, who holds a doctoral degree in clinical psychology and is the author of Facing the Climate Emergency, a book due out next spring. She is also the executive director of The Climate Mobilization, a nonprofit calling for a World War II-scale mobilization to rapidly slash global warming pollution. "They make sense. They are based in reality. They are based in your love for this world and for humanity." "You want to be a robot who doesn't care that all life is threatened? Hell, no," she said. Trebbe Johnson, the author of Radical Joy for Hard Times, also encourages acceptance of despair and grief about environmental destruction. "Recognize that you can't always change things in the moment," she said. "That kind of acceptance does not mean submission or capitulation. It simply means that you ground yourself in what is, so that you can move to the next step." So what is that next step? Consider these suggestions. Get informed, but recognize the psychological toll Patrick Houston, an organizer with New York Communities for Change, recently helped pass a bill to slash climate pollution associated with buildings in New York City. He said the first step to coping with climate despair is to learn more about the issue. He acknowledged that staying up-to-date with climate news can be daunting: "That comes at the emotional cost of constantly reading about the terrible situation that we've gotten ourselves into and how we're digging the hole deeper," he said. So he suggested choosing just one source to follow consistently. One option: InsideClimate News, the Pulitzer Prize-winning news site focusing on climate and energy. Houston also recommended identifying your elected officials at the local, state, and federal level. What do they say about climate change? Votesmart.org is one place to research a politician's stance on the issue. Connect with others Salamon said it's common for people who are knowledgeable about climate change to feel alienated from others. They might experience thoughts like, "No one understands. No one wants to talk about it. I'm kind of sitting here all alone with this horrible information." Not true. Nearly 70% of American adults are worried about climate change, making it a mainstream concern. Try talking about your fears with friends, family, or people in your community who are working to address the problem. "There is true relief in the fellowship of others who understand and who are grieving," Salamon said. Commit to action The next step, Houston said, is civic engagement. It's can be easy to feel cynical about U.S. politics. But Houston said it's important for people to understand that elected officials do in fact pay close attention to their constituents. "Some of those small actions that might not feel like a lot - sending a letter, signing onto a letter, calling your elected official, standing in the street for a rally or protest - even if it doesn't feel like a lot, they should know that elected officials pay a lot of attention to that, even if they don't always listen," he said. His other advice: Volunteer at a level that you can sustain over time. Many people can find time to get involved with one organization, but not a dozen. "It can be less overwhelming if you're just zoned in and focused on one goal rather than freaking out and trying to address every single part of the climate crisis by spreading yourself thin and volunteering with a bunch of different organizations," he said. Seek reasons for hope "What we're dealing with is horrible, but it is calling on us to be better," Salamon said. She said she takes inspiration from reading about how Americans responded to World War II. After the shocking attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. rapidly transformed its economy to produce goods for the war effort. People grew vegetables in victory gardens. Gasoline, meat, sugar, and other commodities were rationed, "which by and large Americans accepted cheerfully as part of the war effort," she said. There are advantages to that kind of mentality, she said: "It's actually a much better way of living to be working with your neighbors and your whole society for a common purpose." And unlike the case of a world war, she added, "This time, we don't need to kill anybody." * Sarah Kennedy contributed reporting.

Pentagon revised Obama-era report to remove risks from climate change

WASHINGTON - Internal changes to a draft Defense Department report de-emphasized the threats climate change poses to military bases and installations, muting or removing references to climate-driven changes in the Arctic and potential risks from rising seas, an unpublished draft obtained by The Washington Post reveals. The earlier version of the document, dated December 2016, contains numerous references to "climate change" that were omitted or altered to "extreme weather" or simply "climate" in the final report, which was submitted to Congress in January 2018. While the phrase "climate change" appears 23 separate times in the draft report, the final version used it just once. Those and other edits suggest the Pentagon has adapted its approach to public discussion of climate change under President Donald Trump, who has expressed doubt about the reality of a phenomenon that scientists agree presents an increasing danger to the planet. While military leaders have said they see a changing climate as a driver of instability worldwide, they have also sought to stay out of a politically charged debate about its causes. Heather Babb, a Pentagon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the draft report, which outlines the results of the department's first survey of officials at different installations about the effects of climate change. 
The Post was not able to verify who made the changes reflected in the two documents. "As highlighted in the report, the effects of climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to missions, operational plans, and installations," Babb said in a statement. "DOD continues to focus on ensuring its installations and infrastructure are resilient to a wide range of threats, including climate. The Department has a proven record of planning and preparing for such threats." According to John Conger, who served as a senior Pentagon official under the Obama administration and was among the officials who initiated the multi-base survey that forms the basis of the report, employees from a dozen different Defense Department offices could have made changes to the text as it made its way through the bureaucracy's clearance process, which often makes for "lowest common denominator" documents. Conger said the alterations "change the feeling of urgency in the report, but not its fundamental conclusion - that our military installations are clearly experiencing climate impacts." The final document, a 32-page report to Congress, was published more than a year after the earlier draft. It, like its earlier version, finds that out of more than 3,500 military sites around the world, 782 reported being affected by drought, 763 by major wind events, and 706 by flooding, along with other problems - results that drew considerable attention when they debuted in late January. But the December 2016 draft was far more direct in its discussion of climate change and in particular the issue of sea-level rise - a well-known problem facing many military sites in coastal areas, from the sprawling naval base in Norfolk to the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site in the Pacific's remote Marshall Islands. Seas are currently rising by about 3.2 millimeters per year, and scientists fear the rise could accelerate in coming decades. The final Pentagon document even omits, in several cases, the simple observation that learning about bases' vulnerability to sea-level rise was a core part of the survey that is the subject of the report. That survey itself asked each military site how much of its area was located at elevations between 0-3, 0-6, 0-9, or 0-12 feet above sea level. The final document also removes a map showing "those sites that indicated possible effects could occur due to increased mean sea level between 0-3 feet." (A few references to sea-level rise do remain in the final version of the report and in the survey questions themselves, contained in an appendix.) "The wordsmithing, not saying 'climate,' I could live with that," said Dennis McGinn, a retired Navy vice admiral who served as assistant secretary of the Navy for energy, installations and environment in the Obama administration, when some of the changes were described to him. "But taking out ... maps of critical areas of flooding, that's pretty fundamental. And the Arctic, that's huge, for a lot of reasons, not just for Department of Defense, but for the Coast Guard, and commercial shipping business." The report emerged from a process commenced by the previous administration, as officials in Washington sought to get a sense of how climate-related phenomena could affect military installations dotting the globe. President Barack Obama's focus on climate change created a sense of urgency for federal agencies, including the behemoth Defense Department, to prepare for its effects. The published version removes a reference to the National Climate Assessment, which the U.S. government, by law, undertakes every four years. It also omits several references to the decline of Arctic sea ice, an ongoing phenomenon that has been strongly attributed to climate change. One such case is found in a description of conditions at the Cape Lisburne radar station on Alaska's North Slope. A statement that "the past decades have seen a climate-related downward trend in the extent of Arctic sea ice coverage" does not appear in the final report, nor does a description of extreme weather events being "made more destructive by a reduction in sea ice and an increase in ice free periods," since without protective sea ice, large waves can pummel fragile Arctic coastlines during storms. And where the draft report says that shoreline erosion at the site is caused by "reduced sea ice coverage," the final document instead blames the damage on "sea ice fluctuations." In another omitted section, the draft document addresses ways in which a changing climate could affect the ability to train troops. "The changing climate could increase risk to the 420 endangered species that live on our installations, potentially leading to training and operating restrictions," the omitted section reads. "Increased high-heat days limit the training and testing activities our personnel can safely perform without appropriate rest periods," it continues. The survey at the center of the report, in its various versions, asked military installations a battery of detailed questions about different extreme events that have affected them, along with requesting information about installations' elevation and vulnerability to sea level rise. Among the questions asked were: - "Has your installation been negatively impacted by wind?" - "Has your installation been negatively impacted by extreme hot or cold temperatures?" - "What might be negatively impacted/degraded with an increase of 0 to 12 feet in mean sea level?" Current and former officials said that the wording and content of the report was unlikely to have a bearing on how the military services respond - or do not respond - to climate change. In some ways, the military has been seen as proactive in its attitude to climate issues, seeking to protect infrastructure in places such as Norfolk from changing weather, producing a massive climate change "road map" and planning for changes in the Arctic. In other ways, however, the military has taken only modest action as it operates its massive network of power-intensive bases and air, ship and vehicle fleets, and provides food and housing to its personnel around the world. "I think in DOD, there is generally a belief, it's more important what you do than to fight about how you talk about it," said Jeffrey Marqusee, a former director of environmental and energy research and development at the office of the secretary of defense. "It's not like they've generally been in denial mode," said Sherri Goodman, who served as deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security in the Clinton administration. "They've generally been pretty forthcoming."

Climate change endangers bird habitats, then birds

We found a highly unlikely bird last month during the Christmas Bird Count at Cantigny - a Nashville warbler. The species migrates through our region in the spring and early fall, and during those times it's pretty easy to spot one. But after October? Good luck with that.
So what was a Nashville warbler doing here on Dec. 19? And what about the painted bunting that caused a media sensation in New York City, also in December?
The knee-jerk response to these questions might be two words: climate change. Or an even better guess: El Nino. But cases of misplaced birds are nothing new. Storms and strong winds are often to blame, or sometimes a bird's internal compass just goes haywire. Birds get lost.
That said, warmer conditions may cause a wayward bird to stay put in the same place for days or weeks, assuming it locates a food source. It learns to adjust.
Indeed, the ability of birds to adapt to new environmental conditions is one of their key strengths. That's the good news. The bad news is that global warming in the decades ahead will test their resourcefulness like never before.
In November I went to hear a talk about the effects of climate change on birds in the Chicago region. The speaker was Doug Stotz, a conservation ecologist and ornithologist at the Field Museum in Chicago. He's also the co-chairman of the Chicago Wilderness Climate Change Task Force.
"The great thing about climate change is that it makes our winters warmer," Stotz said. "It's hard, as a Chicagoan, not to think that's a good idea."
Yes, I think we could all agree that ditching the down-filled parkas and flannel-lined jeans would be OK. And what birder around here would not enjoy some traditionally southern or southwest species moving into our region as average temperatures climb?
We know it's wrong, but it's hard to stop visions of painted buntings and scissor-tailed flycatchers from dancing in our heads. A few southern beauties are already here.
"Blue grosbeak, summer tanager and yellow-throated warbler are birds that didn't use to breed in the Chicago area, but they do now," Stotz said.
But whatever advantages climate change may hold for shivering Chicagoans and thrill-seeking birders, Stotz made one thing perfectly clear: Global warming is not good for most birds. The science tells us so.
In 2014, the National Audubon Society unveiled a seven-year study on the predicted impact of climate change on North American bird populations.
Out of 588 species studied, 314 were deemed at risk from global warming by 2080. For many, according to Audubon's climate model, the "gathering storm" will come sooner. To survive, the birds must adapt to losing huge portions of their current living areas.
Stotz cited the bobolink, a grassland species that even now struggles to prosper in the Chicago region. Climate change is shifting the bird's range northward. By 2050, he said, "Bobolinks are going to be in what is now boreal forest. It seems unlikely that will work."
Of the 314 at-risk species identified by Audubon, 126 are classified as "climate endangered," meaning they are projected to lose more than 50 percent of their current range by 2050 if global warming continues at its current pace.
Even common birds not listed in the Audubon study could vanish from our region due to climatic stress. The black-capped chickadee, Stotz said, could vacate Illinois, moving north as temperatures rise.
Avian visitors we look forward to seeing only in winter may no longer "drop down." If you are lucky enough to see a redpoll, a crossbill or northern shrike this winter, savor the experience. Spotting these and other species in the Chicago region may become significantly more challenging.
Sorry, that's the birder in me coming out again. Climate change is not about birding, of course. It's about the gradual disruption of ecosystems and all the flora and fauna that depend on those systems being in balance.
The global climate talks in Paris last month yielded a glimmer of optimism. We'll see.
"It's easy to feel overwhelmed," Audubon's President and CEO David Yarnold wrote more than a year ago, and I'll bet he feels the same way today. Don't we all?
For those who study birds, there is hope. Through effective habitat management, Stotz thinks the bobolink and other vulnerable species can be saved.
"One of the big things we can do to fight climate change is to get our natural areas into the best condition possible," he said. "There is no question that birds in a healthy environment can hold on in the face of climate change much better than if they are already stressed."

Of the 314 at-risk species identified by Audubon, 126 are classified as "climate endangered," meaning they are projected to lose more than 50 percent of their current range by 2050 if global warming continues at its current pace.
Even common birds not listed in the Audubon study could vanish from our region due to climatic stress. The black-capped chickadee, Stotz said, could vacate Illinois, moving north as temperatures rise.
Avian visitors we look forward to seeing only in winter may no longer "drop down." If you are lucky enough to see a redpoll, a crossbill or northern shrike this winter, savor the experience. Spotting these and other species in the Chicago region may become significantly more challenging.
Sorry, that's the birder in me coming out again. Climate change is not about birding, of course. It's about the gradual disruption of ecosystems and all the flora and fauna that depend on those systems being in balance.
The global climate talks in Paris last month yielded a glimmer of optimism. We'll see.
"It's easy to feel overwhelmed," Audubon's President and CEO David Yarnold wrote more than a year ago, and I'll bet he feels the same way today. Don't we all?
For those who study birds, there is hope. Through effective habitat management, Stotz thinks the bobolink and other vulnerable species can be saved.
"One of the big things we can do to fight climate change is to get our natural areas into the best condition possible," he said. "There is no question that birds in a healthy environment can hold on in the face of climate change much better than if they are already stressed."

The year 2020 is unlike any other, as we deal with unforeseen and staggering crises. But when it comes to the projected effects of climate change in our area, events continue to reflect expected trends. During the spring of 2019, the Northwest suburbs experienced extensive flash flooding. This year, Chicago set a May rainfall record - for the third year in a row. 
In fact, the previous record rainfall total from 2019 was surpassed on May 19 at 8.37 inches. According to the National Weather Service, six to eight inches of rain fell across most of the northwest suburbs - 150% or more above normal for May. But numbers are irrelevant when you're sloshing through water and muck in your home, don't have electricity or can't get through an intersection on your way to work or the grocery store. Our stormwater sewers can't handle the volume of rain we're getting. Most were originally designed for "100-year floods." Unfortunately, such heavy rainfall events are now happening much more frequently. Flooding is devastating commercial centers and residential areas of many of our communities. As the frequency of extreme rainfall events increases, so too do the associated costs. Residents and business owners are hauling ruined furniture to the curb, replacing soaked wall board, navigating insurance claim procedures, and trying to restore their homes and establishments. Many of the affected buildings are not in a designated flood plain and may not have flood insurance, leaving the owners to deal with the costs of repairs. And just like last year, the 2020 hurricane season has already established new records. For the first time, two hurricanes traveled through the Gulf of Mexico at the same time. Several storms were notable for the rapid intensification caused by higher water temperatures in the Gulf. And Hurricane Sally just dumped 30 inches of rain on Pensacola, Florida. Although the Gulf is close to 1,000 miles away, the remnants of these storms generate additional rainfall and flooding here in the Midwest. The National Weather Service reported that flooding in the Midwest in 2019 caused an estimated $6.2 billion in damage. Federal, state, and local governments are now purchasing properties that flood repeatedly. According to the head of the National Flood Insurance Program, buyouts are the most permanent way to mitigate against future flood hazards. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has announced $500 million in initial funding to relocate people whose property frequently floods. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has started a similar $16 billion program. These are matching grants and require funds from the local municipalities or local agencies. The city of Des Plaines provides a local example of working with FEMA on property buyouts. According to data from FEMA, some homes in the city have been damaged by flooding eight or nine separate times since the mid-1980s. To date, more than 60 homes in the Big Bend subdivision have been purchased and returned to open land. As the Daily Herald reported, FEMA granted $2.3 million to Des Plaines to acquire 13 flood-prone homes. The city of Des Plaines will pay 25% of the purchase price. Local municipalities are also dealing with recurring flooding through infrastructure projects. In the past five years, the Daily Herald has reported on major stormwater initiatives in at least nine suburban communities. These initiatives total more than $200 million. In addition, local agencies are actively expanding flood plain maps and updating zoning restrictions to discourage development. Local municipalities and other governmental agencies are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on projects that react to the changing conditions caused by the climate crisis. Climate change is driving these costs, and taxpayers ultimately pay. Climate disruptions will only get worse and costs will increase unless we act now to decrease our carbon emissions. In the upcoming election, you can prioritize candidates' commitment to act on climate change when you vote. We need to elect officials who are prepared to take decisive action to reduce carbon emissions. * Deni Mathews, of Bartlett, is the group lead for the Fox Valley Chapter of Citizens' Climate Lobby.

A local effort to tackle climate change Climate: Power plant operator says changes have been made

Addressing climate change is at a critical point, according to Lake County leaders and environmentalists who rallied on the Lake Michigan shore Saturday to launch an initiative aimed at combating the issue locally. Extensive flooding in Lake County last month is one example of the destructive consequences of a "climate on steroids" that can't be ignored, said Julio Cesar Guzman, an organizer with the Sierra Club, a national grass-roots environmental group. "We saw the impact of climate change. It was a burdensome reality," he said in advance of Saturday's event in Waukegan. 
Local action is critical because the federal government has "abdicated its role in climate leadership," according to the Sierra Club. Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor joined supporters in introducing the Lake County Climate Action Pledge, which urges community leaders and officials to take bipartisan action on the what was described as a climate crisis. "If we get a coalition of county, state and federal leaders, we can bite off a piece of that challenge," Lawlor said. The initiative was introduced in front of the NRG Energy Inc., coal-fired power plant, as part of Clean Power Lake County's fourth annual beach rally and cleanup. The pledge has three "pillars": Move Lake County beyond coal, adopt ambitious clean energy goals, and build climate-resilient infrastructure. Those goals do not suggest specific measures but are designed to encourage local officials to minimize environmental impacts when considering projects. "How are we building in a smart way that will mitigate the next big rain event?" Guzman explained. Any initiative will include closing the NRG plant, he said. The facility, which produces enough electricity to serve the needs of about 668,000 households, has been a target in recent years for Clean Power Lake County because of air and water emissions. "No one can say we want to tackle climate change knowing it's catalyzed by carbon emissions," Guzman said. "It needs to be addressed." NRG spokesman David Gaier said the company has invested $107 million in additional emission controls at the Waukegan plant and the company meets all laws and regulations. "We promised to modernize the plant and make it cleaner and greener, and that's what we've done," he said. The Waukegan plant produces electricity for a grid covering 13 states and Washington, D.C. Investments there and elsewhere in Illinois have "single-handedly" achieved 64 percent of statewide carbon emission reductions called for in the federal Clean Power Plan, Gaier said. Dismantling that plan by the new administration has been decried by environmentalists. Lawlor said local officials can take actions that have a larger impact, such as revitalizing the lakefront in Waukegan. That would be a boost to the city and the region, but it won't happen with an operating power plant, Lawlor said. "We might as well have an orderly process of what the facility becomes," he said. "The sooner the better on the power plant and the sooner the better on its closure." Gaier said coal-powered plants will be phased out eventually, and he noted the company retired one of the two coal units at its Romeoville plant and converted the Joliet plant to natural gas. However, there is a short-term need for "controlled" coal plants in the power generating system, he said. The company in April met with leaders of the Sierra Club and Clean Power Lake County and said the plant is economically viable and continues to supply affordable and reliable power to Illinois consumers, he said. Meanwhile, Lawlor and others urged fellow officials to take action to reduce the county's carbon footprint. "This pledge offers a window of opportunity for civic engagement," Guzman said.

World Bank: Climate change could result in 100 million poor

STOCKHOLM - Climate change could push more than 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030 by disrupting agriculture and fueling the spread of malaria and other diseases, the World Bank said in a report Sunday.
Released just weeks ahead of a U.N. climate summit in Paris, the report highlighted how the impact of global warming is borne unevenly, with the world's poor woefully unprepared to deal with climate shocks such as rising seas or severe droughts.
"They have fewer resources and receive less support from family, community, the financial system, and even social safety nets to prevent, cope and adapt," the Washington-based World Bank said.
How to help poor countries - and poor communities within countries - deal with climate change is one of the crunch issues in talks on a global climate accord that's supposed to be adopted next month in Paris.
Those who say that rich countries aren't doing enough to help the poor said the report added emphasis to demands for billions of dollars in so-called climate finance to developing countries.
"The statistics in the World Bank report are suitably shocking and I hope they force world leaders to sit up and take notice," said Mohamed Adow of Christian Aid. "The Paris deal needs to support the poor and vulnerable communities to cope with unavoidable climate crises better, and to be more resilient to a changed climate."
Despite pledges to rein in emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases, climate change isn't likely to stop anytime soon. Carbon emissions are expected to rise for many years as China, India and other developing countries expand the use of fossil fuels to power their economies.
But efforts to protect the poor, such as generally improving access to health care and social safety nets, and targeted measures to upgrade flood defenses and deploy more heat-tolerant crops could prevent most of the negative consequences of climate change on poverty, the bank said.
"Absent such good development, climate change could result in an additional 100 million people living in extreme poverty by 2030," the report said.
Stephane Hallegatte, one of the authors, said one of the unique features of the report was that instead of analyzing the macroeconomic impact of climate change it was based in part on surveys of 1.4 million people in 92 countries.
"When we ask people why they fall into poverty there are three major factors," he said. "Agricultural shocks, including an increase in food prices; natural disasters such as floods, droughts, storms; and health issues, including malaria, diarrhea."
The report referred to studies showing climate change could result in global crop yield losses as large as 5 percent by 2030 and 30 percent by 2080. It also referenced studies showing warming temperatures could increase the number of people at risk for malaria by 150 million.
Hallegatte said the "hot spots" for climate impacts on poor people were sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
The U.S. and other countries have collectively pledged to scale up climate financing to developed countries to $100 billion annually by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change and reduce their emissions.
Developing countries are calling for commitments beyond 2020 in the Paris agreement but rich nations are reluctant to make firm promises, in part due to budget uncertainties.
A recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated climate finance flows to developing countries reached $62 billion in 2014.w

Republicans playing the long game on term limits Recount: Kirk's statement about climate change raises eyebrows Recount: Kirk's statement about climate change raises eyebrows

A key effort of the Rauner campaign has re-emerged in the Legislature, but the suburban lawmaker behind it says he's playing the long game.
State Rep. Ron Sandack, a Downers Grove Republican, has proposed an amendment to the Illinois Constitution calling for 10-year term limits for state lawmakers.
Rauner tried to get a similar measure put before voters on the November ballot, but it was tossed in court. Still, it remained a major talking point for a campaign running against the Springfield establishment.
Sandack says he knows that establishment - Democrats who control the House and Senate - won't let his plan go anywhere.
Plus, opponents of term limits say cutting off experienced lawmakers puts government in the hands of people who aren't term-limited and can profit from their knowledge - like lobbyists.
Sandack says he didn't introduce it in conjunction with Rauner but hopes keeping the issue alive could help drive public support for another push in 2016.
"The folks in charge of the
General Assembly are still in charge," Sandack said.
Mappin'
For a term-limits plan to succeed in Illinois, backers might need more help with legal support than voter support because the courts tripped it up.
Sandack is also behind a similarly fated plan to change the way state political boundaries are drawn. Democrats redrew the legislative and congressional maps on their own in 2010 and stand to reap the benefits until the next census.
The idea to change the process also got booted off the ballots by courts last year, and moving it through the Legislature would be asking the people who drew the maps to change the game. Again, quite unlikely.
Elimination game
Republican state Rep. David McSweeney of Barrington Hills won House approval of his amendment eliminating the lieutenant governor's office in 2013. But it was never approved by the Senate and died.
He's trying again this year. Will things be different with Republican Evelyn Sanguinetti of Wheaton sitting in the No. 2 spot?
It wouldn't take effect until after the 2018 election if voters approved it in 2016. And Republicans are backing the plan to merge the state's comptroller and treasurer offices, too.
Climate question
In an interview this week, U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, a Highland Park Republican, said he'd like President Barack Obama to back his plan to ban sewage dumping in the Great Lakes.
It was an opportunity to ask Kirk about climate change, given that lately some environmental activists have criticized Kirk for a comment he made to trade publication E&E Daily.
Here's how the publication quoted him: "We had the previous warming period, which was called the global optimum, and the best way to talk about that is when Leif Erickson went west from his home, he discovered a landmass that he called Greenland, because it was. And that was called the global optimum, because the planet was much warmer. By calling Greenland 'green land,' we know that the climate has been changing pretty regularly within recorded memory."
Kirk's office originally responded with this statement: "Climate change is real and human beings definitely play a role. As I have said since 2010, I will not support a carbon tax or similar attempts which hurt the Illinois or American economy."
This week, before the State of the Union address, Kirk said he didn't want to get into a climate change discussion.
"I would say that my top environmental goal is to back this sewage dumping ban in the Great Lakes," he said.
"I would like people to sit back in another generation and marvel at how pristine the Great Lakes are," he said.

Pentagon revises report, removes 'climate change' and some effects

WASHINGTON - Internal changes to a draft Defense Department report de-emphasized the threats climate change poses to military bases and installations, muting or removing references to climate-driven changes in the Arctic and potential risks from rising seas, an unpublished draft obtained by The Washington Post reveals. The earlier version of the document, dated December 2016, contains numerous references to "climate change" that were omitted or altered to "extreme weather" or simply "climate" in the final report, which was submitted to Congress in January 2018. While the phrase "climate change" appears 23 separate times in the draft report, the final version used it just once. Those and other edits suggest the Pentagon has adapted its approach to public discussion of climate change under President Donald Trump, who has expressed doubt about the reality of a phenomenon that scientists agree presents an increasing danger to the planet. 
While military leaders have said they see a changing climate as a driver of instability worldwide, they have also sought to stay out of a politically charged debate about its causes. Heather Babb, a Pentagon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the draft report, which outlines the results of the department's first-ever survey of officials at different installations about the effects of climate change. The Post was not able to verify who made the changes reflected in the two documents. "As highlighted in the report, the effects of climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to missions, operational plans, and installations," Babb said in a statement. "DOD continues to focus on ensuring its installations and infrastructure are resilient to a wide range of threats, including climate. The Department has a proven record of planning and preparing for such threats." According to John Conger, who served as a senior Pentagon official under the Obama administration and was among the officials who initiated the multi-base survey that forms the basis of the report, employees from a dozen different Defense Department offices could have made changes to the text as it made its way through the bureaucracy's clearance process, which often makes for "lowest common denominator" documents. Conger said the alterations "change the feeling of urgency in the report, but not its fundamental conclusion - that our military installations are clearly experiencing climate impacts." The final document, a 32-page report to Congress, was published more than a year after the earlier draft. It, like its earlier version, finds that out of more than 3,500 military sites around the world, 782 reported being affected by drought, 763 by major wind events, and 706 by flooding, along with other problems - results that drew considerable attention when they debuted in late January. But the December 2016 draft was far more direct in its discussion of climate change and in particular the issue of sea-level rise - a well-known problem facing many military sites in coastal areas.

14th District candidates back green energy but far apart on climate change

14th District candidates back green energy but far apart on climate change Both candidates for the 14th Congressional District support the pursuit of green energy, but climate change is a different story. Incumbent Republican Randy Hultgren has a polar opposite perspective from his Democratic challenger, Lauren Underwood, when it comes to what's fueling climate change and steps taken to address it so far. Hultgren joined the bipartisan, 74-member Climate Solutions Caucus in April. The mission of the caucus is to explore economically-viable options to "reduce climate risk" and work on legislation that can "address the impacts, causes and challenges of our changing climate" and also receive bipartisan support when it comes time for a vote. 
In announcing his admission into the caucus, Hultgren pointed to his interest in modernizing Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab, and giving Illinois' communities choices in where their energy comes from as his motivation. St. Charles' work with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency to bring solar power to the area is a prime example of creating such choice. In written interviews subsequent to the caucus announcement, Hultgren indicated he is not on board with all the stances his new caucus members take when it comes to climate change. For one, the caucus pushed President Donald Trump to maintain the United States' commitment to the Paris climate accord. Hultgren does not support that agreement. "I don't support climate change policies that place American workers behind the rest of the world," Hultgren said. "The Paris agreement hurt American workers and allowed Chinese factories to keep polluting at extremely high levels." Part of Hultgren's objection to the Paris agreement stems from what he views as a "flawed premise" in the Clean Power Plan that Trump administration officials are trying to repeal. The plan is considered former President Barack Obama's signature climate change policy. It created new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants. Hultgren said the plan was not "grounded in law and the Constitution" and he believes it will not withstand a legal challenge. Hultgren said encouraging new, cleaner energy production is a better method to reduce carbon pollution than punishing users of less clean forms. "The carrot is better than the stick, and federal R & D (research and development) will help emerging technologies to get to the point of adoption," he said. Underwood takes the opposite view. In a written interview, she said pulling out of the Paris agreement was "a mistake." "We ceded our international leadership role, and we are not unable to achieve an important multilateral goal of reducing emissions," she said. She believes the Clean Power Plan was "a strong step" to curb carbon pollution and reduce methane from the oil and gas industry. "The Trump Administration's attempt to dismantle the Clean Power Plan is hazardous to our planet and is an economic and environmental threat to our country," Underwood said. Neither candidate directly answered a question about whether they support any form of a tax on carbon polluters. Likewise, when asked how much humans have contributed to climate change, Hultgren said there "are a number of contributing factors." "Humans have certainly polluted the earth, and it is our responsibility to develop cleaner technologies," he said. "I teach my kids we are stewards of the earth, and we have a responsibility toward it." Underwood said she believes the science to date includes clear evidence "that human activity is a significant catalyst toward climate change, producing increased carbon emissions that have caused lasting damage to our planet."

Poles apart on climate change Green: Democrat says pulling out of Paris accord was a mistake

Both candidates for the 14th Congressional District seat support the pursuit of green energy, but climate change is a different story. Incumbent Republican Randy Hultgren has a polar opposite perspective from his Democratic challenger, Lauren Underwood, when it comes to what's fueling climate change and steps taken to address it so far. Hultgren joined the bipartisan, 74-member Climate Solutions Caucus in April. The mission of the caucus is to explore economically viable options to "reduce climate risk" and work on legislation that can "address the impacts, causes and challenges of our changing climate" and also receive bipartisan support when it comes time for a vote. 
In announcing his admission into the caucus, Hultgren pointed to his interest in modernizing Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab and in giving Illinois' communities choices in where their energy comes from as his motivation. St. Charles' work with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency to bring solar power to the area is a prime example of creating such choice. In written interviews subsequent to the caucus announcement, Hultgren indicated he is not on board with all the stances his new caucus members take on climate change. For one, the caucus pushed President Donald Trump to maintain the United States' commitment to the Paris climate accord. Hultgren does not support that agreement. "I don't support climate change policies that place American workers behind the rest of the world," said Hultgren, who lives in Plano. "The Paris agreement hurt American workers and allowed Chinese factories to keep polluting at extremely high levels." Part of Hultgren's objection to the Paris agreement stems from what he views as a "flawed premise" in the Clean Power Plan that Trump administration officials are trying to repeal. The plan is considered former President Barack Obama's signature climate change policy. It created new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants. Hultgren said the plan was not "grounded in law and the Constitution, and he believes it will not withstand a legal challenge. Hultgren said encouraging new, cleaner energy production is a better method to reduce carbon pollution than punishing users of less clean forms. "The carrot is better than the stick, and federal R&D (research and development) will help emerging technologies to get to the point of adoption," he said. Underwood, a Naperville resident, takes the opposite view. In a written interview, she said pulling out of the Paris agreement was "a mistake." "We ceded our international leadership role, and we are not unable to achieve an important multilateral goal of reducing emissions," she said. She believes the Clean Power Plan was "a strong step" to curb carbon pollution and reduce methane from the oil and gas industry. "The Trump Administration's attempt to dismantle the Clean Power Plan is hazardous to our planet and is an economic and environmental threat to our country," Underwood said. Neither candidate directly answered a question about supporting any form of a tax on carbon polluters. Likewise, when asked how much humans have contributed to climate change, Hultgren said there "are a number of contributing factors." "Humans have certainly polluted the earth, and it is our responsibility to develop cleaner technologies," he said. "I teach my kids we are stewards of the earth, and we have a responsibility toward it." Underwood said she believes the science to date includes clear evidence "that human activity is a significant catalyst toward climate change, producing increased carbon emissions that have caused lasting damage to our planet." The sprawling 14th Congressional District includes parts of DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry counties. The general election is Nov. 6.

Lake County leaders pledge to tackle climate change

Lake County leaders pledge to tackle climate change Addressing climate change is at a critical point, according to Lake County leaders and environmentalists who rallied on the Lake Michigan shore Saturday to launch an initiative aimed at combating the issue locally. Extensive flooding in Lake County last month is one example of the destructive consequences of a "climate on steroids" that can't be ignored, said Julio Cesar Guzman, an organizer with the Sierra Club, a national grass-roots environmental group. "We saw the impact of climate change. It was a burdensome reality," he said in advance of Saturday's event in Waukegan. 
Local action is critical because the federal government has "abdicated its role in climate leadership," according to the Sierra Club. Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor joined supporters in introducing the Lake County Climate Action Pledge, which urges community leaders and officials to take bipartisan action on the what was described as a climate crisis. "If we get a coalition of county, state and federal leaders, we can bite off a piece of that challenge," Lawlor said. The initiative was introduced in front of the NRG Energy Inc., coal-fired power plant, as part of Clean Power Lake County's fourth annual beach rally and cleanup. The pledge has three "pillars": Move Lake County beyond coal, adopt ambitious clean energy goals, and build climate-resilient infrastructure. Those goals do not suggest specific measures but are designed to encourage local officials to minimize environmental impacts when considering projects. "How are we building in a smart way that will mitigate the next big rain event?" Guzman explained. Any initiative will include closing the NRG plant, he said. The facility, which produces enough electricity to serve the needs of about 668,000 households, has been a target in recent years for Clean Power Lake County because of air and water emissions. "No one can say we want to tackle climate change knowing it's catalyzed by carbon emissions," Guzman said. "It needs to be addressed." NRG spokesman David Gaier said the company has invested $107 million in additional emission controls at the Waukegan plant and the company meets all laws and regulations. "We promised to modernize the plant and make it cleaner and greener, and that's what we've done," he said. The Waukegan plant produces electricity for a grid covering 13 states and Washington, D.C. Investments there and elsewhere in Illinois have "single-handedly" achieved 64 percent of statewide carbon emission reductions called for in the federal Clean Power Plan, Gaier said. Dismantling that plan by the new administration has been decried by environmentalists. Lawlor said local officials can take actions that have a larger impact, such as revitalizing the lakefront in Waukegan. That would be a boost to the city and the region, but it won't happen with an operating power plant, Lawlor said. "We might as well have an orderly process of what the facility becomes," he said. "The sooner the better on the power plant and the sooner the better on its closure." Gaier said coal-powered plants will be phased out eventually, and he noted the company retired one of the two coal units at its Romeoville plant and converted the Joliet plant to natural gas. However, there is a short-term need for "controlled" coal plants in the power generating system, he said. The company in April met with leaders of the Sierra Club and Clean Power Lake County and said the plant is economically viable and continues to supply affordable and reliable power to Illinois consumers, he said. Meanwhile, Lawlor and others urged fellow officials to take action to reduce the county's carbon footprint. "This pledge offers a window of opportunity for civic engagement," Guzman said.

Climate change keeps changing the game for home gardeners

Section: HOME GARDEN; Pg. 0

Every year now, gardeners should be rethinking what they grow and where because of climate change, experts say. The growing season has become longer, delivering bigger harvests but requiring more weeding and controls. Plants are under stress because of rising temperatures, less frequent but more intense precipitation, and changed pest and disease problems. Flowers and the insects that pollinate them are falling out of sync. 
"Conditions have become more challenging for gardeners since the weather has become more unpredictable," says Richie Steffen, executive director and curator of the Elizabeth Miller Botanical Garden in Seattle. "We've had much hotter summers, while our winters have been all over the place," he says. "Some were dry. Some were very wet. And in this region at least, our wet spells tend to come with much heavier rains rather than our typical misty rains." The average home gardener should examine water use, and estimate how much of that precious resource is going to be necessary and available in the future, he says. "Be less rigid about lawns and not so fastidious about keeping them watered all summer," Steffen says. "Create more habitat and extend the flowering season for pollinators. "And be more selective about plant selection. Many things not so readily available 20 or 30 years ago are available now." The most trustworthy plants are those that regenerate quickly and can handle extremes, says Jessi Bloom, owner of NW Bloom EcoLogical Services in Redmond, Washington. "Another group of plants to consider is edibles, for personal resiliency and food security," she says. The climate in 2025 will be different even from that in 2020, so take that into account when doing your landscape planning, says Sara Tangren, invasive species foreman for Empire Landscape in Silver Springs, Maryland. "For perennials, stick with locally native plants. But when it comes to trees, look to a broader range," Tangren says. ''I'm not recommending natives when talking trees. Go for something instead that can take the heat." You also can expect more dormancy in lawns, she says. "They'll be going brown in summer, but you can transform that look in part and save on mowing by deciding which portions of the yard you really use," Tangren says. "Start planting perennials, shrubs and trees there instead." Precipitation is becoming more intense but less frequent, and temperatures are getting hotter, she notes. "Two inches of rain used to be a big deal around here, but now we're seeing 7 inches. That sounds like plenty, but when it falls in one day and the average temperature is 5 to 10 degrees higher, then the evaporation rate is higher and you don't have any access to it," Tangren says. "Soils don't store water as readily when they get too much at a time." Many things are blooming earlier than ever before and also lasting longer into the fall. "That's giving us more production but also more work," she says. Trees are leafing out faster, while the window for wildflower blooms is getting slower and they're being shaded out. "That means they won't be there for the insect pollinators and the songbirds, and this reverberates through the whole system,'' Tangren says.

Money men tally cost of climate change

NEW YORK - Climate change is likely to exact enormous costs on U.S. regional economies in the form of lost property, reduced industrial output and more deaths, according to a report backed by a trio of men with vast business experience.
The report is designed to convince businesses to factor in the cost of climate change in their long-term decisions and to push for reductions in emissions blamed for heating the planet.
It was commissioned by the Risky Business Project, which describes itself as nonpartisan and is chaired by former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Thomas F. Steyer, a former hedge fund manager.
"If we act immediately, we can still avoid most of the worst impacts of climate change and significantly reduce the odds of catastrophic outcomes," Paulson said.
Among the predictions: Between $66 billion and $106 billion in coastal property will likely be below sea level by 2050, labor productivity of outdoor workers could be reduced by 3 percent because extremely hot days will be far more frequent, and demand for electricity to power air conditioners will require the construction of more power plants that will cost electricity customers up to $12 billion per year.
"Every year that goes by without a comprehensive public and private sector response to climate change is a year that locks in future climate events that will have a far more devastating effect on our local, regional, and national economies," warn the report's authors.
The analysis and calculations in the report were performed by the Rhodium Group, an economic research firm, and Risk Management Solutions, a catastrophe-modeling company that works for insurance companies and other businesses. It was paid for by the philanthropic foundations of Bloomberg, Paulson and Steyer, among others.
The report analyzes the impacts of climate change by region to better show how climate change affects the businesses and industries that drive each region's economy.
* The Northeast will likely be most affected by sea level rise, which will cost an additional $6 billion to $9 billion in property loss each year.
* The Southeast will likely be affected both by sea-level rise and extreme temperatures. The region, which has averaged eight days of temperatures over 95 degrees each year, will likely see an additional 17 to 52 of these days by midcentury and up to four months of them by the end of the century. This could lead to 11,000 to 36,000 additional deaths per year.
* Higher temperatures will reduce Midwest crop yields by 19 percent by midcentury and by 63 percent by the end of the century.
* The Southwest will see an extra month of temperatures above 95 degrees by 2050, which will lead to more frequent droughts and wildfires.
The report does not calculate the cost of these droughts or wildfires, or many other possible costs such as the loss of unique ecosystems and species and the possible compounding effects of extreme weather conditions. Nor does it calculate some of the ways economies could adapt to the changing climate and reduce the costs of climate change.
"There's a whole litany of things not calculated in the assessment," said Gary Yohe, an economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University and vice chair of the National Climate Assessment, a U.S. government project set up to study the effects of climate change. Yohe was not part of the Risky Business Project report, but he was asked to review it.
Still, he said, "The general conclusions are right on the money."
He also said that while other groups have also attempted to calculate the financial impacts of climate change around the world, this report is notable because of the business and financial experience of the people behind it. Beyond the three co-chairs, the members of the group's risk committee include Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, former Cargill CEO Gregory Page, and George Shultz, former treasury secretary and secretary of state.
"These are people who have managed risk all their lives and have made an enormous amount of money doing so," Yohe said.

Schakowsky, Sangari spar on health care, climate change

Health care, foreign policy and climate change were among the topics discussed this week in a Daily Herald endorsement interview with candidates running to represent the 9th Congressional District. The race pits longtime Democratic incumbent Jan Schakowsky against Republican challenger Sargis Sangari. Schakowsky said she is proud of her role in the passage of the Affordable Health Care Act. 
"I believe that every American, every person in the United States, should have the right - not the privilege - the right to health care, affordable accessible health care," she said. She said she supports adding a public option, allowing people to choose "a Medicare-like option when they go onto the exchange" to sign up for insurance. Said Sangari, a retired Army lieutenant colonel: "I was never a fan of the ACA. I thought it was just large government. I don't think it was well thought out. But with that said, the constituents in my district like it." He said he would work to keep what works and get rid of what doesn't. Addressing the standing of the U.S. on the world stage, Schakowsky bemoaned President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord and withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, as well as his criticism of the World Health Organization. She also said Trump has enabled authoritarian regimes. "So for most of my adult life, the United States was looked to as a beacon of democracy, a country that would lead in negotiations, that would make alliances around the world to create more peace, and I think that that has actually disappeared." Sangari - who is still active in foreign affairs through the Near East Center for Strategic Engagement, a think tank he founded - said Trump's actions on the foreign policy front have promoted peace. "I can only just look at the reality on the ground that there's actually more peace on the ground in the Middle East," he said. "A lot of the Asian countries that were initially in the hemisphere of China have turned against China because they're not happy with what China has been doing." He also said he supported pulling out of the Paris and Iran agreements, calling the latter "a disaster" that was basically an economic deal. On the issue of climate change, Schakowsky said: "I think the problem of climate change is existential. It is the question of whether or not human life will be able to survive on this planet." Sangari said the solution is to bring scientists from both sides of the climate issue together. He said the United States has already made technological advances in bringing carbon emissions under control and he supports free market approaches. The 9th District covers much of the North Shore but also stretches into Des Plaines and Park Ridge.

Money men tally cost of climate change
NEW YORK - Climate change is likely to exact enormous costs on U.S. regional economies in the form of lost property, reduced industrial output and more deaths, according to a report backed by a trio of men with vast business experience.
The report, released Tuesday, is designed to convince businesses to factor in the cost of climate change in their long-term decisions and to push for reductions in emissions blamed for heating the planet.

The region, which has averaged eight days of temperatures over 95 degrees each year, will likely see an additional 17 to 52 of these days by midcentury and up to four months of them by the end of the century. This could lead to 11,000 to 36,000 additional deaths per year.
- Higher temperatures will reduce Midwest crop yields by 19 percent by midcentury and by 63 percent by the end of the century.
- The Southwest will see an extra month of temperatures above 95 degrees by 2050, which will lead to more frequent droughts and wildfires.
The report does not calculate the cost of these droughts or wildfires, or many other possible costs such as the loss of unique ecosystems and species and the possible compounding effects of extreme weather conditions. Nor does it calculate some of the ways economies could adapt to the changing climate and reduce the costs of climate change.
"There's a whole litany of things not calculated in the assessment," said Gary Yohe, an economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University and vice chair of the National Climate Assessment, a U.S. government project set up to study the effects of climate change. Yohe was not part of the Risky Business Project report, but he was asked to review it.
Still, he said, "The general conclusions are right on the money."
And he said that while other groups have also attempted to calculate the financial impacts of climate change around the world, this report is notable because of the business and financial experience of the people behind it. Beyond the three co-chairs, the members of the group's risk committee include Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, former Cargill CEO Gregory Page, and George Shultz, former treasury secretary and secretary of state.
"These are people who have managed risk all their lives and have made an enormous amount of money doing so," Yohe said.

Every year now, gardeners should be rethinking what they grow and where because of climate change, experts say. The growing season has become longer, delivering bigger harvests but requiring more weeding and controls. Plants are under stress because of rising temperatures, less frequent but more intense precipitation, and changed pest and disease problems. 
Flowers and the insects that pollinate them are falling out of sync. "Conditions have become more challenging for gardeners since the weather has become more unpredictable," says Richie Steffen, executive director and curator of the Elizabeth Miller Botanical Garden in Seattle. "We've had much hotter summers, while our winters have been all over the place," he says. "Some were dry. Some were very wet. And in this region at least, our wet spells tend to come with much heavier rains rather than our typical misty rains." The average home gardener should examine water use, and estimate how much of that precious resource is going to be necessary and available in the future, he says. "Be less rigid about lawns and not so fastidious about keeping them watered all summer," Steffen says. "Create more habitat and extend the flowering season for pollinators. "And be more selective about plant selection. Many things not so readily available 20 or 30 years ago are available now." The most trustworthy plants are those that regenerate quickly and can handle extremes, says Jessi Bloom, owner of NW Bloom EcoLogical Services in Redmond, Washington. "Another group of plants to consider is edibles, for personal resiliency and food security," she says. The climate in 2025 will be different even from that in 2020, so take that into account when doing your landscape planning, says Sara Tangren, invasive species foreman for Empire Landscape in Silver Springs, Maryland. "For perennials, stick with locally native plants. But when it comes to trees, look to a broader range," Tangren says. ''I'm not recommending natives when talking trees. Go for something instead that can take the heat." You also can expect more dormancy in lawns, she says. "They'll be going brown in summer, but you can transform that look in part and save on mowing by deciding which portions of the yard you really use," Tangren says. "Start planting perennials, shrubs and trees there instead." Precipitation is becoming more intense but less frequent, and temperatures are getting hotter, she notes. "Two inches of rain used to be a big deal around here, but now we're seeing 7 inches. That sounds like plenty, but when it falls in one day and the average temperature is 5 to 10 degrees higher, then the evaporation rate is higher and you don't have any access to it," Tangren says. "Soils don't store water as readily when they get too much at a time." Many things are blooming earlier than ever before and also lasting longer into the fall. "That's giving us more production but also more work," she says. Trees are leafing out faster, while the window for wildflower blooms is getting slower and they're being shaded out. "That means they won't be there for the insect pollinators and the songbirds, and this reverberates through the whole system,'' Tangren says.

Lake Michigan a boon in climate change era, but faces some risks

It's easy for Illinois residents to take Lake Michigan for granted. Only a sliver of the state fronts it, unlike Michigan and Wisconsin. Many residents might have only seen it on the occasional trip to Chicago. Even suburban residents go years, if not decades, without dipping a toe in it. 
But changes in the climate change Lake Michigan. How much should you worry about that? If you have lakeshore property, maybe a lot. Climate change seems to be leading to more dramatic swings in the lake's water-height cycle, according to Jennifer Caddick, vice president of communications and engagement for the Alliance for the Great Lakes, a nonprofit group devoted to protecting the Great Lakes. If you live inland and are among the millions who drink, cook and water lawns with Lake Michigan water, maybe a little. Some forms of pollution are increasing, but Lake Michigan's depth helps protect against toxic algal blooms that have created dead zones or sent illness-causing bacteria into water supplies in other parts of the Great Lakes. 90% of U.S. fresh water Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes - the world's largest system of freshwater resources. The lakes - nicknamed the "Sweetwater Seas" - account for 19 percent of the world's fresh water and 90 percent of the fresh water in the United States. Lake Michigan is the second-largest in volume, after Lake Superior. It is 307 miles long, 118 miles wide, and reaches a maximum depth of about 925 feet. Breezes that pass over the lake in the summer are noted for cooling off downtown Chicago. Snowstorms passing over open portions in winter pick up moisture, hitting northwest Indiana hard with lake-effect snow. The Illinois International Port District advertises the Port of Chicago as "America's Fourth Coast," handling 19 million tons of cargo a year. Navy Pier says that more than 9 million people visited the entertainment attraction in 2016. We're justly proud of the efforts of architect Daniel Burnham and others, who persuaded politicians to put parks along much of the Chicago shoreline, rather than factories and docks. Infrastructure threatened Lake levels have gone through cycles before, according to historical records. But scientists believe increasing warmth in the atmosphere in North America is leading to more compressed cycles, with higher highs and lower lows. High water levels eat away at beaches, retaining walls and other areas along the shoreline. The Chicago Park District has lost a North Side beach and sustained significant damage to two others and is beginning aerial mapping to study beach erosion. "Those cycles are starting to change in unpredictable ways," Caddick said. When air temperatures are warmer, water temperature increases (and ice coverage decreases). Warm water evaporates more, especially in cooler air in the fall and early winter, according to a report from the Environmental Law and Policy Center. A more-saturated atmosphere leads to heavier, more violent storms. Warmer water helps harmful algae, and some invasive species such as quogga mussels, to thrive. Increased precipitation, particularly heavier events, are increasing pollution flowing into the lake, over the ground and via sanitary-sewage releases, according to Caddick. Some current sewage-treatment systems, especially combined stormwater-sanitary-sewage systems, can't handle the volume of more frequent, heavier storms, she said. To avoid having sewage back up in buildings, they open the gates at treatment plants and release untreated sewage into the lake, or into rivers that lead to the lake. "That's not good to have that extra pollution flowing into our rivers and lakes," Caddick said. Drinking water What about our drinking water? The Metropolitan Planning Council estimates that 6.6 million people in northern Illinois rely on Lake Michigan for drinking water. A 1967 Supreme Court decision enables Illinois to divert up to 2 billion gallons per day, through water plants, the Chicago River and several sewage and shipping canals. Much of the potable water flows through two city of Chicago plants, including 1 billion through the James W. Jardine Water Purification Plant, which is touted as the world's largest. Chicago's plants don't just serve the city; water from them is served up to residents of many Cook suburbs, and nearly all towns in DuPage County. One of the other treatment plants belongs to the Central Lake County Joint Action Water Agency, in Lake Bluff. The plant's interim director, Bill Soucie, doesn't expect climate change to significantly affect the agency's ability to deliver water. "It (the lake) just doesn't change that quickly," Soucie said. His agency draws an average of 19 million gallons a day. The intake devices are located 3,000 feet out from shore, and about 26 feet below the surface. Even if climate change puts more water in the Lake Michigan basin, that's an advantage to his agency; the more water on top of the intakes, the faster it flows to the treatment plant, he said. Soucie said his agency hasn't experienced the troubles other areas throughout the Great Lakes have seen, such as toxic algal blooms. Harmful bacteria from a bloom forced the City of Toledo to turn off drinking water for three days in 2014. The blooms are caused largely by nutrient-laden fertilizer runoff, but warmer water temperatures help them grow, according to Caddick. The Chicago area might be less likely to face that problem, she said, due to much less fertilizer runoff and increased depth. Indirect effect? What if people further inland, running out of water in their aquifers, want to get Lake Michigan water? The 2008 Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact would prevent that. The compact, between the eight Great Lakes states, says that only areas that are in the Great Lakes basin can use its water. (The ability of Illinois plants to send Lake Michigan water to communities outside the basin is governed by the earlier court order.) Only parts of Cook and Lake counties are in the basin. But if a lot of people moved here as climate refugees from areas having significant environmental changes, there could be issues. Illinois uses an average of 76 percent of its allocation, according to the Metropolitan Planning Council. And the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning estimated in 2012 that 22 billion gallons of that was wasted - leaking out of pipes before it ever got to users. Replacing our crumbling public infrastructure would help, but the report notes a lack of willingness or ability to spend the money necessary to do so.

Demonstrators demand that Roskam address climate change

More than 200 people rallied Monday in West Chicago to call on U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam to take action on climate change and support clean energy.
The demonstrators, some of them holding signs with slogans such as "Follow the science" and "Clean energy creates jobs," gathered in a large meeting room down the hall from Roskam's district office at the DuPage Airport before dropping off postcards for the congressman.
"We want to let him know that we think we need to do something about climate change," said Tim Milburn of the Sierra Club Northwest Cook County Group.
Milburn said local Sierra Club chapters organized Monday's rally because they're concerned that President Donald Trump's administration may reverse the progress that's been made on climate change mitigation and clean energy.
Organizers decided to reach out to Roskam because "he's not exactly a climate change proponent," Milburn said. He added that Roskam has "a bad record when it comes to dealing with this environmental issue."
J.C. Kibbey said during the rally that 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is real.
"Climate change is happening and it is caused by humans," said Kibbey, Midwest outreach and policy advocate for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "There is no continuing debate in the scientific community. And there is no question that the science is conclusive."
To fix the problem, "we need to move to a clean energy economy as soon as possible," he said.
Jack Darin, director of the Sierra Club's Illinois chapter, said everyone who attended the rally is "part of the majority" of residents in Roskam's 6th Congressional District "who want to keep moving forward." The district includes parts of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry counties.
"We want to listen to the scientists and act on climate change," Darin said. "Move beyond dirty fuels to clean energy for all the benefits that it offers to all the citizens of the 6th District, our country and our planet."
While there's a new president, Darin said, people in the 6th District didn't vote to stop creating jobs in solar and wind and energy conservation.
"They didn't vote to opt out of the global effort to stand up and solve climate change," he said.
Therefore, Roskam and other members of Congress should support efforts "to make sure the worst of President Trump's promises will never come true," Darin said.
Roskam wasn't at his district office Monday. According to a spokesman, he was in Washington D.C.
The spokesman issued a statement saying that Roskam supports an "all-of-the-above approach when it comes to energy."
"American ingenuity has made it possible to rid ourselves of our dependence on foreign oil and eliminate a major national security threat," the statement reads. "Each year, new advancements in technology and research allow us to better provide for our energy and security needs while safeguarding our natural resources for the future."

'There is uncertainty, but there is also really, really great certainty. We've ruled out 'fine.' 'Fine' is not going to happen' There's a common adage among scientists and statisticians: "All models are wrong, but some are useful." That's certainly true in the modern world, where - despite the fact that they're by nature mere shadows of real-world scenarios - computer models serve as vital guideposts in some of humanity's most complex and dangerous pursuits, from skyscraper and bridge construction to air and space travel. In the world of climate science, models have come under particularly intense scrutiny, with some skeptics dismissing them entirely. 
At the same time, thousands of scientists are banking on these models as guideposts for the planet's future. What makes them so sure? "(Climate) models encapsulate everything we know about how the world works," says Andrew Gettelman, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. The equations that are their foundation are ones we use over and over, and are interwoven in the fabric of our lives. "If we didn't understand thermodynamics and we didn't understand water and how water condenses, internal combustion engines wouldn't work," he says. "If we didn't understand fluid dynamics, we couldn't predict the weather, we couldn't make pipe systems work, and make chemical plants work. None of the physics in climate models is new." That said, today's models are incredibly complex, taking into account a multitude of processes that affect climate, and uncertainty is part of their DNA. They offer a range of scenarios based on human actions - the choices we make around mitigating carbon emission, for instance - but there also is uncertainty in the forecasts each model gives, and a difference in what the top models being used tell us. Take the most basic: long-term global temperature increase. Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, notes that what the models predict ranges from warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius to 4.5 degrees Celsius - and that gap hasn't materially changed as models have gotten more sophisticated. "That's kind of bonkers," says Marvel. "A degree and a half is not that bad, and 4 1/2 degrees is totally catastrophic." But Marvel, and others, worry that communicating scientific uncertainty to the broader public can be misinterpreted: "There is uncertainty, but there is also really, really great certainty," she says. "We've ruled out 'fine.' 'Fine' is not going to happen." Scientists generally welcome uncertainty, says Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University. Differences among climate models help show the points where they agree, and the elements we can really trust, and the range of results they give help us understand the risks of various actions. "Uncertainty doesn't mean you should not take action because you don't know the outcome," says Shindell. "It means you should be very cautious about the extremes happening because you can't rule them out." Simulated worlds A lot of the confusion about models comes from a misunderstanding of what they are, and what they aim to do, says Gettelman. The models aren't theoretical worlds so much as simulated ones, constrained by laws of physics and chemistry and constantly being validated against observations, recent history, and the deep past. Climate models aren't designed to predict specific weather or events, but they do predict the probability of weather patterns and weather extremes occurring. Today's models require massive supercomputers to run them. The Community Earth System Model Gettelman works on relies on some 1.5 million lines of code. Most climate models break the Earth down into a 3-D grid system, calculating that system for grids at various longitudes and latitudes and heights into the atmosphere. As the models improve, those grids get ever finer and incorporate more elements of the climate system. These simulations have come a long way from the basic energy-balance model that Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish scientist, used to demonstrate the greenhouse effect back in the 1890s. But in essence, they're not that different from the far more basic climate models that scientists were using four or five decades ago. "At their heart, (models) follow basic physical laws that are very well understood," says Shindell. "We have theory and we have observation and we have measurements in the real world that all hold together." Kicking the tires Rather than blindly trusting the models out there, climate scientists are constantly questioning them, says Katharine Hayhoe, co-director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University. "The more you know about models, the less you trust them, and the more you kick their tires," Hayhoe says. She knows what they're good at, like simulating observed changes in temperature and the jet stream. And she knows what they do less well, such as modeling how quickly the ice sheets are melting or the rate that Arctic sea ice is lost. In those cases, as with extreme precipitation, many models actually are underestimating how fast things are changing, says Hayhoe. Models are also better at predicting changes over a bigger time and space scale than they are at forecasting those changes for smaller regions, or the nearer-term future. And, when it comes to the big differences among what the models tell us, scientists are getting better at understanding where that gap comes from. One of the major reasons: clouds. The clouded view Clouds have become a huge focus of many climate scientists because of the large impact they have on climate. But cloud formations are incredibly complicated to model reliably. Clouds have a warming effect, because they act like a blanket over the Earth. But they also have a cooling effect, as white clouds reflect solar energy away. The net effect of clouds on the planet tends to be cooling, explains Gettelman, and it's a huge effect. "Small changes to clouds can really magnify or damp what we do with carbon dioxide," he says. Given all that, clouds are one of the most important things for a climate model to get right, but also one of the hardest. The scale at which clouds form is tiny: liquid water droplets crystallizing around a dust grain. "That is incredibly small scale," Dr. Marvel says, "but of course climate models need to simulate the entire climate, which is the largest scale you can get, and those don't match very well together." To get around that, models approximate clouds in various ways, but it's an imperfect science, and much of modelers' efforts these days go into improving and refining those approximations. They're also starting to bring in other key parts of the climate system, like the biological processes involved in the carbon cycle - how natural land- and ocean-based carbon sinks may shift in the future. Building a virtual planet Despite all these uncertainties, scientists emphasize that the models are consistent on the most basic points: The Earth is warming. We'll get more days of extreme temperatures, with dangerous levels of heat. And there will be more extreme precipitation events. What's perhaps most disconcerting to many climate scientists is the fact that with the most recent generation of models, which have worked hard to incorporate more processes and reduce structural uncertainties, many have started running "hotter" - showing temperature changes in the long term of 5 or 6 degrees C instead of 4 degrees - and it's not yet clear why that is. These newer models might be more accurate, Marvel says, but without fully understanding why what they're telling us has changed, she doesn't think their results can be totally accepted. But what scientists emphasize over and over is that while the models they work with may not be perfect - and are almost certainly "wrong" at some level - they offer us the most complete, and validated, way we have of understanding our climate trajectory. In essence, the models are the laboratories that climate scientists use. Earth scientists can't build anything in the real world that replicates our entire system, so "in order to conduct experiments on our planet, we have to build a virtual planet," Hayhoe says. Climate models "are like alternative Earths that we can run what-if experiments on," she continues, "which further underscores the fact that we are currently running an unprecedented, although inadvertent, experiment with our actual planet, which is the only home that we have." * This story originally appeared in Christian Science Monitor and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalistic collaboration to strengthen coverage of the climate story.

UN chief: Governments must 'act faster' on climate change UN Secretary General António Guterres says governments around the world are not responding fast enough to address problems of a changing climate. But in an interview with Covering Climate Now, a worldwide consortium of news outlets focusing coverage on climate change this week, he says he sees encouraging signs that citizens are beginning to put the kind of pressure on their leaders that is needed "to make governments understand that they need to run faster." The interviewers included Mark Herstgaard of Climate Change Now, CBS's Mark Phillips, and Amanda Mars, of El País. To see the interview in English, click here.

Images: The impact of climate change Earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, floods and pestilence are nothing new to Planet Earth or even to our comparatively brief human experience here. But, because of humankind's impact on the environment, are these phenomena growing more frequent and more intense? Nature, it has been said, does not need us; we need Nature. These photos show some of what may be in store if we don't get control of the activities that scientists say are changing our climate.

There's a certificate on the wall of Dave Lowe's small cottage in Petone, Wellington, New Zealand. It could easily be missed by a passing guest. But if they cared to take a second glance, three words would immediately jump out: Nobel Peace Prize. It's the 2007 Prize, awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Lowe was a lead author on their largest-ever report. 
It was by far the greatest honor of his career. He resigned almost immediately afterward, walking away on top of the scientific world. The Prize is a testament to all that he has achieved in his career, but at the same time, to him, it's a haunting reminder of all the things he didn't, or couldn't, change. "I've lived this horror for 50 years," he says. "There's so little time left and we've just been so bloody stupid." Dave Lowe was one of the first people on Earth to find measurable proof that human activities were changing the atmosphere and warming the planet. For the past 50 years, he has watched on, helpless and frustrated, as the situation around him has gotten worse, and worse, and worse. Volcano over clouds The world's largest volcano dominates the skyline of Hawaii's Big Island. The huge, sloping sides and gigantic crater of Mauna Loa cast an imposing shadow and send a constant warning across the Pacific paradise. The Ancient Hawaiians believed Mauna Loa was created by the volcano goddess Pele, who formed it at such an immense height so she could escape the wrath of her sister Namaka, the sea goddess. According to one legend, Pele is accompanied by a phantom white dog. When an eruption was soon to occur, she would send her dog down the mountain to warn the people of the impending disaster. In 1958, an American scientist named Charles David Keeling climbed Mauna Loa, and changed the world's understanding of our climate forever. Keeling had spent the better part of the 1950s perfecting a system of measuring exactly how much of which gases make up Earth's atmosphere. By adapting gas analyzers used in coal mines, he was able to take the first reliable reading of the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. It was here, in two simple gray buildings set against a desolate, otherworldly landscape, that Keeling established the world's first permanent station to measure CO2 levels. The gas analyzer splits a sample of air into 1 million parts, and counts how many of those are CO2. The first measurement Keeling took read 313 parts per million. Then, as he continued to take regular readings, he saw something no one had ever seen before. The planet was breathing. In autumn, as the leaves died off the trees, the amount of CO2 in the air would rise. Then in spring, as the plants grew again, the number would fall again. In and out, like lungs exhaling. Then, when a full year had gone by and the cycle was complete, he checked the number again. It never returned to 313. Now, it sat at 314 ppm. He had just uncovered the first piece of evidence that the total amount of CO2 in the air was increasing. That matters because CO2 has an insulating effect in the atmosphere. It traps heat, which is why it's called a greenhouse gas. More CO2 means more heat. Every year without fail, for the last 61 years, the number has continued to climb. The chart that tracks the rising CO2, that drumbeat on the march to climate breakdown, is called the Keeling Curve. Some would say that the legends of Mauna Loa are true. Pele's white dog has become Keeling's gas analyzer, high in the mountains among the ancient volcanic rock, sending out a warning signal to tell the people of the coming disaster. A worldwide search While Keeling was tracking the first evidence of climate change on a Hawaiian volcano, Dave Lowe was a teenage high school dropout in Taranaki, New Zealand, with only one thing on this mind: surfing. "You go out there and man, do you get a feeling for the environment. I saw the atmosphere directly, going down into the ocean, mixing the sounds, the smells." Sitting on his board, staring out at the mist and the ocean spray dancing against the pink hues of the setting sun, he decided he needed to understand more about the world around him. He went back to school and earned a physics honors degree from Victoria University of Wellington. Lowe and Keeling's paths would cross for the first time in 1970. By this time, Keeling was a giant in his field. But he wasn't satisfied with his research station at Mauna Loa. One measurement at one specific location wasn't enough evidence. He wanted a global record, in both hemispheres, so he could confirm what he was seeing, and track it for future decades. Lowe was a 23-year-old graduate at the former Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, recruited to join Keeling's team as they set up the world's second continuous record of atmospheric CO2. They found a spot about 30 minutes out of Wellington city, near Makara Beach, at the World War II-era gun emplacements of Fort Opau. The first failed attempts to record atmospheric CO2 in New Zealand were made at Fort Opau, a gun emplacement built in 1941 to protect the Wellington harbor. After six months training in California, Lowe returned to join the small American team of one scientist and two technicians. But pretty soon he found himself with far more responsibility than he expected. "The scientist would constantly just bugger off back to San Diego for six months at a time. And the technicians, well ... they were being paid to have the holiday of their lives. They were always off hunting and fishing, not to speak of the marijuana. "I was thrown in the deep end trying to run hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of gear on a really important project which is being funded millions by the National Science Foundation." But that work was for nothing. The readings at Makara were erratic, showing wild swings and no discernible pattern. They were useless. There was about a kilometer of paddocks between the sea and the analyzer that was sucking up too much CO2 and throwing off the readings. Keeling told him he needed to develop a new portable gas analyzer and find a new location, undisturbed by vegetation or outside sources. After some searching, Lowe found the spot he was looking for at Baring Head, a peninsula an hour out of Wellington in the opposite direction, at the base of the Remutaka Forest Park. It was perfect. At the right time, Baring Head gets air currents directly from Antarctica, an incredible undisturbed run through hundreds of kilometers of the Southern Ocean. The first thing they learned was that Baring Head always measured a few ppm behind Mauna Loa. The majority of emissions are produced in the northern hemisphere; this showed that it took time for those gases to spread south. They also found that Baring Head didn't show the same huge seasonal swings as the Mauna Loa readings. The huge continents of vegetation in the northern hemisphere were affecting the Hawaiian readings, but the measurements in the South Pacific, surrounded by ocean, were far more stable. Yet the most important thing was that in both the south and the north, the carbon in the atmosphere was slowly rising. James Renwick is a professor of geology at Victoria University, who was also a contributor to the 2007 Nobel Prize and received last year's Prime Minister's Science Prize. He says Lowe is "a bit of a legend in NZ atmospheric science," and his contributions to the global record of climate change were invaluable. "At the time I suspect it wasn't appreciated just how important the Baring Head Station was, but now the climate science community really values the long time series from Baring Head." "That's very significant," he says. "They are a part of a global network of observing sites that have taught us many things. Dave Lowe has been a real pioneer in atmospheric science in NZ, especially around measurement of greenhouse gases and in understanding the chemistry of the atmosphere and how that's changing." The grind Finding himself in charge of a groundbreaking research with barely any experience, Lowe put everything on his own shoulders. Together with his friend and colleague Peter Gunther, they were basically running the entire southern arm of the operation alone, and they were fully aware of how important their work was. That meant constant flights between Wellington and California, reading every background paper that had ever been written on the subject, developing all the computer programs to drive the calculations. "We worked our butts off," he says. "I knew that I just had to do this. I threw everything I had into it." But that intensity had its consequences. Eventually, something had to give. The single-minded drive Lowe had dedicated to his pursuit of science cost him his marriage. "I just kept on going as my marriage crashed. I was a real mess. A hell of a mess. I was working too hard, and completely blown apart emotionally. "The guy I was working for took a look at me and said, 'Dave, you're no good to me at all in your condition.'" Proof or persuasion In 1975, Lowe took a sabbatical to recover from his professional and personal blowout. He attended the first scientific conference of greenhouse gas experts. He reckons he's probably the only person at the meeting who is still alive. The small group knew what was coming before anyone else in the world. They had proved that mankind was changing the chemical makeup of the air, and they knew the inevitable outcome of that. The terms "global warming" and "climate change" hadn't been invented yet, but that's exactly what they were seeing. In the following years, Lowe moved to Germany to study further, and met his now-wife Irena. They've been married for 40 years. He specialized in isotopic techniques, which he describes as like DNA tracing for gas particles. Not all the CO2 in the atmosphere is from the burning of fossil fuels. For most of human history, the CO2 level has naturally fluctuated between 200 and 300 ppm, which we know thanks to air samples trapped in glacier ice cores. Those natural fluctuations are often cited by climate deniers to suggest that climate change is not man-made. Naturally occurring carbon is made up of different isotopes. The most common types are called Carbon-12 and Carbon-13. Carbon-12 is by far the most common type found in nature. Carbon-13 makes up about 1% of the total. But the exact amount can differ. There is slightly less Carbon-13 in fossil fuels like coal and oil compared to in atmospheric carbon. Lowe and other international researchers found that while total CO2 in the air was increasing, the percentage of Carbon-13 isotopes compared to Carbon-12 was decreasing. That proved that the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was coming from the burning of fossil fuels by humans, not anything else. "That's the smoking gun. You can get every skeptic blue in the face, but that's just open and shut evidence that this extra CO2 came from humans," he says. That was proof, settled science. But the battle to convince the public of his findings was only just beginning. Part of the problem was that the predicted temperature rise didn't show up for several years. While CO2 was rising, the mercury was jumping up and down, with no consistency. But eventually, the signal separated from the noise and the heat started to climb. Once it did, it basically never stopped. In hindsight, the conservative approach of the scientific community probably held progress back for a number of years, he says. "As a scientists, we thought, 'No, you don't jump up and down and scream; we're not activists.' Losing our credibility was the big issue. "It was a totally different time. If only I knew then what I know now ... . Now it's different. Many of us are out there doing stuff. We have to. This is an emergency." Full-blown arguments with climate change deniers have been a common occurrence in Lowe's life. His voice bristles with frustration when the topic comes up. "It's better now, but it was hard yards. I'd be yelled at by people. It used to be constant shouting matches with skeptics. "(Scientists) deal in data and facts and graphs and numbers, it's really hard to get through with that. In my lifetime I've given hundreds of climate change talks and you're always up against it with this distrust." Nothing grinds his gears more than scientists in the 1980s and 1990s who deliberately spread mistruths about climate change while on the payrolls of oil companies, like Fred Singer and others profiled in the 2010 book "Merchants of Doubt." "I just think ... the bastard, how dare he not look at the facts. That makes me angry, people who deliberately go out and falsify what's going on." After resigning, Lowe started his own small family business, consulting and doing climate change education. After his children left home, he and Irena moved into their small cottage, which they meticulously designed to have the smallest possible carbon footprint.

Fires rage across the American West. Hurricanes batter the East Coast. Rising seas inundate coastal cities. In many parts of the United States, the signs of climate change are hard to miss. But the Great Lakes region of the Midwest has been considered something of a climate haven, a place to seek refuge from the ravages or stresses of climate change. 
That reputation, however, could be figuratively and literally eroding. Researchers say climate change is indeed impacting the Great Lakes. It's eroding shorelines, altering ecosystems, and causing flooding and economic damage. But scientists hoping to communicate the effects of climate change on the lakes have to first confront a seemingly incongruous set of facts: While shoreline communities now gird themselves for flooding, lake levels were at historic lows as recently as 2013. "We're at the beginning of this period of rapid change," University of Michigan climate scientists Prof. Richard B. Rood says. "We're not going to stabilize on something." Rood and fellow University of Michigan Professor Andrew Gronewold are researching the link between the variation in lake levels and climate change. "If you want to understand why water levels are changing, you need to look at precipitation, evaporation, and runoff," Gronewold says. "And if you want to understand why precipitation, evaporation, and runoff are changing, you've got to have a good understanding of climate change on continental and global scales." Because of climate change, when global weather patterns that affect regional climate cause more precipitation, that precipitation is more severe. When those same patterns translate to drier weather, that weather causes greater evaporation from the Great Lakes. "The community of climate skeptics have picked up on what Drew and I have been saying and mocking us for it: 'Well, first low lake levels were climate change, now high lake levels,'" Rood says. Recent rising water levels are having disastrous effects. In May, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo stood along the shore of Lake Ontario and, after lamenting that he'd rather be fishing, said that he was instead declaring a state of emergency. In 2017, high water had flooded shoreline communities and damaged 4,000 properties. "Prepare for a redux of the same situation," the governor told constituents. In the fall, all of the Great Lakes were between 12 and 30 inches above the long-term average. In Chicago, crews began erecting flood barriers along Lake Michigan in September. Near record water levels have almost completely submerged two of the sandy beaches that line the city's lakefront. Condo buildings and other properties that abut the water are shelling out for reinforcements of their own. For cities and towns on the Great Lakes, closing beaches could have big economic consequences. According to a 2013 report from the Great Lakes Commission, an interstate agency, tourism along the 63 miles of Lake Michigan shore in Illinois draws 20 million people annually and recreational activities contribute $3.2 billion to the economy. And climate change isn't just submerging beaches and affecting property owners; it's also impacting aquatic ecosystems. Fish populations are changing in numbers and moving geographically. Some fish like smallmouth bass, for instance, have migrated to warming waters. Some fish, like the lake whitefish, might see growth rates decline. That's according to a recent report on climate change and the Great Lakes by the nonprofit Environmental Law & Policy Center. Invasive species like sea lampreys, a North Atlantic fish that sucks the bodily fluids out of its prey, are growing larger and more deadly to the recreationally and commercially important fish they feed on. As rain and snow become more severe, sewage and farm runoff could increasingly be flowing into the lakes, causing bacteria levels to spike and feeding dangerous algae blooms. The Great Lakes collectively represent about one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water supply. About 10 percent of the U.S. population, 30 million people, lives around them. While climate change will be affecting them, in just what direction may well vary. "It's a lot harder on the Great Lakes to say, 'Hey, climate change is going to lead to increased variability,'" Gronewold says. "What does that mean from a planning perspective? Does that mean that we should be planning for high water levels, low water levels, or both?" The answer, of course, is both. * This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 300 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.

On Monday, April 22, the Environmental Defenders of McHenry County will present the documentary "Chasing Ice" at McHenry County College's Luecht Conference Center, 8900 Route 14, Crystal Lake.
An afternoon showing is planned for 1:30 p.m., and an evening at 7 p.m., with doors opening at 6:30 p.m. The screenings are free and open to the public; donations to help cover costs are accepted.
"Chasing Ice" follows acclaimed environmental photographer James Balog as he heads to the Arctic on assignment for National Geographic. His goal is to capture images that help tell the story of the Earth's changing climate.
A skeptic about global warming when his journey began, Balog discovers undeniable evidence of climate change. Using time-lapse cameras, his videos compress years into seconds and capture ancient mountains of ice in motion as they disappear at a breathtaking rate. The film provides a way to visualize climate change in progress.
An Academy Award nominee, "Chasing Ice" has received many awards since its release last November. This will be the first screening in McHenry County.
This event is sponsored by Environmental Defenders of McHenry County and MCC Down to Earth.
Glacier retreat is the most visible indicator of climate change in the world today. Glaciers are excellent gauges of climate because their retreat, growth, or stasis reflects regional temperature and precipitation patterns.
The vast majority of glaciers in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania are retreating due to warming temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, with the rate of ice loss accelerating in recent decades. Humanity is directly and immediately affected by glacier retreat through water resources, sea level, and ocean circulation. It also acts as an early warning of other climate change impacts now accelerating worldwide.
For more information, see "Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States," U.S. Global Change Research Program, at .
Donations are encouraged and are tax-deductible as charitable contributions. For more information, visit or call (815) 338-0393.

Sierra Nevada a 'living lab' for climate change

SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. - In parts of California's Sierra Nevada, marshy meadows are going dry, wildflowers are blooming earlier and glaciers are melting into ice fields.
Scientists also are predicting the optimal temperature zone for giant sequoias will rise hundreds and hundreds of feet, leaving trees at risk of dying over the next 100 years.
As indicators point toward a warming climate, scientists across 4 million acres of federally protected land are noting changes affecting everything from the massive trees that can grow to more than two-dozen feet across to the tiny, hamsterlike pika. But what the changes mean and whether humans should do anything to intervene are sources of disagreement among land managers.
"That's the tricky part of the debate: If humans are causing warming, does that obligate us under the laws of the National Park Service to try to counteract those effects?" said Nate Stephenson, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
"How do you adapt to a changing climate if you're a national park?" added Stephenson, who is 30 years into a study of trees in the largest wilderness in the continental U.S., Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park.
Since 1895, the average temperature across California has increased by 1.7 degrees, and experts say the most visible effects of that warming occur within the Sierra Nevada, where low temperatures are rising and precipitation increasingly falls as rain rather than snow. Some models show noncoastal California warming by 2.7 degrees between 2000 and 2050, one of many reasons President Obama pledged last week to use executive powers to cut carbon pollution.
The state's two largest rivers - the Sacramento and San Joaquin - originate in the Sierra. The range also is home to Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the Lower 48; and the nation's only groves of giant sequoias, the largest living things on earth.
There are mounting concerns about the beloved sequoias, whose sprawling, 10-foot-deep root systems make them especially vulnerable to drought and heat.
Because the trees exist only in such a small region, scientists are debating whether to irrigate the 65 groves in the southern Sierra to help them endure warmer temperatures.
Otherwise they fear the trees could die. During the last warm, dry period 4,000 to 10,000 years ago, their numbers were greatly diminished, according to pollen evidence collected by researchers at Northern Arizona University.
"Whether we would water them certainly comes up on our climate change scenario planning," said Koren Nydick, science coordinator at Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. "They are a very unusual species because they're also looked on as a social artifact."
Stephenson says his decades of studying conifers in Sequoia National Forest have shown they are dying at twice their historic rate, partly because the climate is warmer and dryer.
The giant sequoias grow much more slowly than conifers over many hundreds of years so changes have been tougher to recognize, though researchers suspect seedlings already may be having a harder time taking root.
"That's always the million-dollar question," said Stephenson, director of USGS's Sierra Nevada Global Change Research Program. "We just don't have a big enough sample size to know what's going on with the giant sequoias, whereas we monitor thousands of pines and firs and have much more confidence."
So far, the dozens of changes researchers have noted, in everything from earlier songbird fledging dates to greater wildfire intensity, may point to a warming climate. But it's far from understood whether that would mean doom or adaptation for California's ecological heart.
"I don't want to say that because we're seeing one thing, that's how it will play out," said Rob Klinger who is studying alpine mammals for the USGS's Western Ecological Research Center. "The endgame of our study is determining whether there will be uniform change or will it be patchwork. If you look at evolutionary time scales, species have gone through these changes before, and they handle it."
As part of a Ph.D. project at the University of California, Merced, Kaitlin Lubetkin for five summers has hiked the backcountry taking inventory of 350 subalpine meadows formed when glaciers retreated eons ago. The marshy ground acts as a reservoir that eases flooding after snow melts, and the stored water feeds streams during dry months and sustains wildlife such as the endangered willow flycatcher songbird and the Yosemite toad, which is being considered for threatened species status.
Over the past decade of warmer, drier conditions, however, pine trees have begun to take root, acting like straws to pull the moisture out of the meadows, Klinger and Lubetkin have observed.
"Pretty much right up to the tree line you're getting encroachment in every meadow," said Lubetkin.
In September, Hassan Basagic of the Glaciers of the American West Project will be hiking to 12,000 feet elevation to measure the Lyell Glacier in Yosemite National Park and monitor the changes he first began observing in the early 2000s. Scientists from Yosemite National Park and the University of Colorado recently noted that the glacier is no longer moving - and is melting - by using measurements they've made over the past four years, as well as some of Basagic's earlier work.
Basagic's used photos from the 1930s to show that in the early 2000s the rate at which the Sierra's glaciers were receding picked up.
"A lot of people call glaciers the `canary in the coal mine.' They're an indicator that the alpine climate is changing," said Basagic, who monitors glacial changes for Portland State University research projects. "With that change, other things will change, like the plants and animals that depend on certain climatic conditions."
Already the American pika, a cold-loving rodent, is moving to higher elevations, and a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report says, "Climate change is a potential threat to the long-term survival."
The USGS's Klinger, however, said pikas might be more resilient than the wildlife service predicts. "It doesn't hibernate and it has dealt with expanding and contracting snow packs and changing temperatures - and yet it persists," Klinger said.
If the trends continue, some species are expected to adapt by finding more hospitable environments, scientists say. One potential place is Devil's Postpile National Monument in the eastern Sierra, where 40 data collection devices are showing that temperature inversions caused by atmospheric pressure are filling the region of steep canyons with colder air.
Scientists are studying whether other areas with similar features might serve as refuges for some species. They're looking at establishing seed banks in the 800-acre park where several climatic regions overlap and more than 400 plants, 100 birds and 35 animals coexist.
"We have an incredible living laboratory to understand what's happening with this cold air pool," said monument Superintendent Deanna Dulen. "We're really trying to get a good baseline of knowledge so we can look at the changes over time. We have the potential to be a refuge, but also to be a place of increased vulnerability. There's so much to learn."

The politics of climate change

Politics interfere with scientific reasoning FACT: Clean air and clean water are crucial. In 1980, the so-called experts were saying the world would freeze over because of pollution. TIME magazine and National Geographic and others reported this. Then, a few years later in 2000, the S-CEs were clamoring that the world would be covered with water in 12 years because of global warming. Apparently, the S-CEs were going the wrong way on the thermometer. 
The facts weren't adding up. What happened then? Let's call it "Climate Change," which is reported in the news media as Fact now. Not so fast. I'm a big believer in common sense. How could scientists conclude there is global cooling? Then, in a blink of an eye 20 years later, the earth is on a trajectory of global warming. That doesn't make sense, does it? Keep in mind, the earth went through a global warming period. Illinois was covered with glaciers up to 10,000 years ago. The melting of glaciers in Illinois wasn't caused by humans, was it? Several publications disagree about global warming. The NIPCC report on scientific consensus titled, "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is a good source to read. It argues that there is no consensus among scientists, there are flawed projections and postulates, unreliable circumstantial evidence, etc. In conclusion, to be fair, scientists always should be in the business of disproving hypotheses. The political climate is getting in the way of scientific reasoning. Let's allow the debate to flourish and allow scientists to debate global cooling, global warming, or the temperature is within historical norms. In the meantime, for those who know the world will end in I guess 10 years, please send me your money. You won't be needing it. I'll be happy to use it for good purposes. Michael Fuechtmann Roselle Celebrities and secular science I recently read about Greta Thunberg being named Time's Person of the Year. Greta Thunberg and celebrity actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who is publicly supporting Ms. Thunberg, are two people without a background in science. And yet their opinions on climate change are apparently highly respected by many. When a once-Christian nation becomes secular, that nation rejects the ultimate authority of God's word and replaces such with the science and opinions of men. As we now know, science, like man's opinions, is ever changing. The corrupt science and emotionally fueled opinions of celebrities are poor substitutes for the wisdom of God. When I was a boy, quite a few years ago, there was an actor that they called the King of Hollywood. His name was Clark Gable. Clark Gable described himself as, "A lucky slob from Ohio." Unlike today's celebrities Mr. Gable never saw his fame as something that gave him wisdom greater than the average American. There was another man of humility that I remember from childhood. Broadcast and print journalist Edward R. Murrow. Mr. Murrow commented on self-important celebrities this way: "Just because your voice reaches halfway around the world doesn't mean you are wiser than when it reached only to the end of the bar." Currently America is at great risk. We steer our ship by the capricious opinions of celebrities and by the deceitful conclusions of scientific experts. Many years ago sailors would guide their ships to safe harbor at night by focusing on the lighthouse. That lighthouse was a constant. It never moved, and so it was a faithful guide. My prayer is that in these dark secular days, America will decide to guide our nation to safe harbor by focusing on God's word, which is a constant. It never changes Charles Danyus Round Lake Beach, Even naughty kids don't deserve lumps of coal Santa might want to rethink his strategy these days. No matter how poorly kids behave, they don't deserve to wake up on Christmas morning to coal in their stockings. When the burning of coal and other fossil fuels is destroying the future of all kids, this is just too cruel. Whether naughty or nice, our kids deserve a clean world in which to live. It's not too late to turn things around. There is a bill in Congress that has the support of conservative, liberal and moderate citizens that would be a great start on giving our kids that clean world. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (HR 763) would put a steadily rising price on carbon and give the net revenue to U.S. citizens in equal shares. The free market takes care of the rest as people and industry choose cheaper clean energy over dirty and increasingly expensive fossil fuels. As long as Santa leaves the coal in the ground, his visit will make even our naughty kids smile. And if we do our jobs as citizens and call our legislators about HR763, we can give that smile a chance to last a life time. Mark Ailes Lombard Support candidates whose eyes are open Scientific study after study has reported that human-caused global warming is the greatest threat of our time. However, Trump and most Republicans pretend that human-caused climate change doesn't exist, use fake or irrelevant facts or claim it's a negligible issue. Their responses remind me of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast from the planet Traal, described in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Beast assumes that "if you can't see it, it can't see you." So you can avoid disaster by shutting your eyes. Unlike avoiding the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, shutting your eyes won't stop climate heating. It still would cause increasing crises in the next decade and will make life unbearable for your children and grandchildren. This is why Marie Wilson's Dec. 2 article on 6th District congressional candidates should be required reading. She reports that Republican candidates Ives and Kinzler say climate warming isn't important to them or district residents. In contrast, Congressman Sean Casten agrees with all reputable scientific studies that climate warming is the single biggest existential threat we face. While Ives and Kinzler are keeping their eyes tightly shut, Rep. Casten is working on bills that would increase the nation's green energy storage capacity, would help develop ways to produce materials without emitting carbon, supports other efforts to mitigate climate changes and, along with the U.S. military, seeks ways to protect our nation against the climate-caused catastrophes that already have begun occurring. This month, he is participating with other Democrats in the annual United Nations Climate Change discussions (COP25). Those who shut their eyes to climate warming along with Ives and Kinzler and other Republican candidates are stealing their children's and grandchildren's future. Please vote to re-elect Sean Casten. Darold Barnum Oak Park It's incomprehensible to deny climate change. The oddest thing about climate change is not the fact of it, but the dialogue about it. Look, the climate is changing, the data is clear. The world is warming. Why is this a political discussion? Why does one party line up to deny man-made climate change? Good news: At least Florida's politicians are finally getting it. Maybe because it affects that state directly. A scientist can point to charts and tables, but that's when the deniers' eyes glaze over. Let me just add one recent datum: Greenland's ice is melting faster than expected and could add 26 inches to sea level by 2100. Source: ScienceFocus.com, BBC and others. Climate change is not a hoax, as some who are politically motivated maintain. Did you ever see a greenhouse on a cold snowy day? The green plants inside are doing just fine. Greenhouse gases work the same way that greenhouse glass works. It's not a political question. You can't lobby Mother Nature. Here are the arguments: "The climate is always changing." Well, yes. Just like there have always been car accidents and for lots of different reasons; does that mean we should barrel through red lights? "The predictions are wrong." Yes, many have been off somewhat. But, so have many of Newton's (you know, the apple and the tree guy) gravity predictions until modified slightly by Einstein. An apple will still fall from a tree despite errors in Newton's law. Even though Newton was wrong, no one is encouraged to walk off a roof. Let's say nine of out 10 doctors tell you that a life threatening tumor you have must be removed as soon as possible. Let's say one out of 10 says, "Nah ... let's wait to see what happens." Which doc's advice would you follow? Sanford Morganstein West Dundee

Chicago museum exhibit drives home climate change

Climate change can be hard for people to understand because humans are adaptable. But other life-forms aren't so lucky.
"We don't have to shiver or pant, we can just change the AC," said Steve Sullivan, senior curator of urban ecology for the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. "Other species can't do that. Change from a biological standpoint is impossible for most organisms. If this summer is half a degree warmer, climatologists are going to freak out but homeowners won't notice a difference."
The museum is helping to educate visitors on the causes and effects of climate change, and how they can help, through the exhibit "Weather to Climate: Our Changing World," which runs in Chicago through Oct. 23 before heading out on tour.
"Climate change is really the defining issue of our time, and we saw that as an issue that we as an institution could address," Sullivan said. "We also noticed that a lot of museums rent traveling exhibits that address pressing issues, but oddly there are no really good, moderately sized traveling exhibits on climate change."
The exhibit opens by explaining the difference between weather and climate, letting kids play dress up in front of a mirror to see how their clothes may change frequently, like the weather. But climate - like a person's wardrobe - is typically consistent over time, depending on where you live. Residents of Hawaii, for example, might wear heavy jackets on occasion, but their overall wardrobe will be lighter than if they lived in Chicago.
"If you look at the political debate, a lot of times we conflate weather and climate," Sullivan said. "The weather you are experiencing at this moment is a data point. It's really kind of irrelevant. That collection of data points that are studied over 30 years equals a meaningful climate data point. When we look at that overall picture, not just what's happening today or yesterday, is when we can really see what's going on."
Kids can also take on the role of a meteorologist, donning suit jackets, standing in front of a green screen in a mock television studio and reading weather reports off a teleprompter while they see themselves amid graphics.
"At the most superficial level you're just interacting with this goofy, fun thing and seeing pictures of weather," Sullivan said. "At the most sophisticated level the text is informing the audience of how weather and climate are changing and
how this affects people."
The middle section of the exhibit addresses the effects of climate change using mounted specimens of red and gray squirrels as an example.
Kids can also spin a wheel of fortune showing different animals and weather conditions they could be exposed to. A video then explains the potential effects. For instance the pika, a miniature rabbit with short ears, lives in high elevations and wouldn't mind colder temperatures. But pikas - who spend cold months eating stores of hay - would not get enough food to survive the winter if it was too wet.
"These specific plants and animals are adapted to specific climactic regimes," Sullivan said. "As those climates change, those animals may be able to adapt, they may be able to move.
But most things that have to adapt to change in the world simply go extinct."
The exhibit ends by exploring how humans are impacting climate change. A sculpture incorporates 94 balls, each filled with a cubic foot of air to represent the amount of carbon dioxide the average American puts out in a day through the burning of fossil fuels.
By following tips for reducing their carbon footprint, visitors can help prevent climate change from getting worse.
"We want to end on a note that empowers people and, importantly, we want to end on a positive note that makes them feel like they can make a difference," Sullivan said.

Caucus will play key role on climate change

Citizens and observers of our federal government are rightly worried by the growth of extreme partisanship. We've seen the repercussions in appointments of judges and other officials, hampering government's ability to function. Add to that the recent funding of government through short-term resolutions, with lawmakers exacerbating lack of trust of their colleagues. While those concerns are justified, it's also important to recognize positive signs when they occur, and the role that we, as citizens, can play toward nurturing bipartisanship. 
Would it surprise you, for example, to learn that large numbers of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House have signed up to look for bipartisan ways to address climate change? Based on national headlines, this would seem unlikely, given how partisan climate change has become. Extended court fights over the EPA's Clean Power Plan instituted under President Obama, are now followed by its dismantling under President Donald Trump's EPA chief Scott Pruitt. Objectively, climate change should be a fairly obvious area for bipartisanship. It's a well-understood problem, with costly repercussions. For example, new research shows that climate change contributed to increased rainfall in hurricane Harvey and to the severity of California's recent six-year drought. The mounting risks from climate change include damage from sea level rise, and more extreme weather. There's nothing partisan about these facts. They point to a problem we need to solve. Damages from storms, droughts and coastal erosion don't single out victims based on their political leanings. The problems presented by climate change are causing attitudes to shift in Congress. Conservatives understand that they bring valuable perspectives to this problem, by helping government promote market mechanisms in the design of fair and effective climate policy. This spirit of collaborative problem-solving led to the formation of the House Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in February 2016. The caucus was started by two South Florida representatives, Democrat Ted Deutch, and Republican Carlos Curbelo. The caucus requires members to join in pairs, one from each party; membership is kept bipartisan with strictly equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. The caucus' objective is clear from its name: design and pass bipartisan legislation to solve the problem of climate change. Over the last year, 44 new members have joined the caucus. The most recent to join are Chicago region Reps. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from the 9th Congressional District in Illinois, and Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican from the 6th Congressional District in Michigan, who announced on Jan. 26 that they have joined together. The caucus now has 68 members, 34 from each party, and over 15 percent of the total U.S. House. These two will join prior members from the Illinois delegation, Reps. Dan Lipinski and Rodney Davis, who joined separately last March. The addition of Reps. Schakowsky and Upton is particularly significant for their leadership roles on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on which both serve (Rep. Upton is former committee chair). In addition to the crucial concern of climate change, there are important lessons in the formation of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. The first is a message of hope: that our representatives reveal themselves to be decent people committed to serving our nation and their constituents. While they are members of political parties, and often compete bitterly to win elections, they still agree that the best policies emerge from building consensus across political divides. The second lesson involves citizen engagement. Growth of the Climate Solutions Caucus has had crucial help from citizens encouraging their representatives, regardless of party, to take action on the issue of climate change. Our democracy is truly participatory, and we make it better when we speak up about issues which concern us. The changing politics of the issue of climate change, and particularly the involvement of conservatives, is due to engagement by leaders such as George Shultz and Michael Bloomberg, as well as by constituents like all of us, making elected officials aware of our concern, and asking them to act on the issue of climate change. So, let's celebrate the recent action of Reps. Schakowsky and Upton in joining the Climate Solutions Caucus. We should be grateful to all its members for their courage and leadership on climate change. Let's also recognize that this is only an important first step; there's much more work to be done on climate change. Our representatives should receive our gratitude when they make Congress work, and they will need the steady and determined encouragement of citizens as they move toward drafting and passing bipartisan climate legislation.

We've seen the repercussions in appointments of judges and other officials, hampering government's ability to function. Add to that the recent funding of government through short-term resolutions, with lawmakers exacerbating lack of trust of their colleagues. While those concerns are justified, it's also important to recognize positive signs when they occur, and the role that we, as citizens, can play toward nurturing bipartisanship. 
Would it surprise you, for example, to learn that large numbers of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House have signed up to look for bipartisan ways to address climate change? Based on national headlines, this would seem unlikely, given how partisan climate change has become. Extended court fights over the EPA's Clean Power Plan instituted under President Obama, are now followed by its dismantling under President Donald Trump's EPA chief Scott Pruitt. Objectively, climate change should be a fairly obvious area for bipartisanship. It's a well-understood problem, with costly repercussions. For example, new research shows that climate change contributed to increased rainfall in hurricane Harvey and to the severity of California's recent six-year drought. The mounting risks from climate change include damage from sea level rise, and more extreme weather. There's nothing partisan about these facts. They point to a problem we need to solve. Damages from storms, droughts and coastal erosion don't single out victims based on their political leanings. The problems presented by climate change are causing attitudes to shift in Congress. Conservatives understand that they bring valuable perspectives to this problem, by helping government promote market mechanisms in the design of fair and effective climate policy. This spirit of collaborative problem-solving led to the formation of the House Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in February 2016. The caucus was started by two South Florida representatives, Democrat Ted Deutch, and Republican Carlos Curbelo. The caucus requires members to join in pairs, one from each party; membership is kept bipartisan with strictly equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. The caucus' objective is clear from its name: design and pass bipartisan legislation to solve the problem of climate change. Over the last year, 44 new members have joined the caucus. The most recent to join are Chicago region Reps. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from the 9th Congressional District in Illinois, and Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican from the 6th Congressional District in Michigan, who announced on Jan. 26 that they have joined together. The caucus now has 68 members, 34 from each party, and over 15 percent of the total U.S. House. These two will join prior members from the Illinois delegation, Reps. Dan Lipinski and Rodney Davis, who joined separately last March. The addition of Reps. Schakowsky and Upton is particularly significant for their leadership roles on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on which both serve (Rep. Upton is former committee chair). In addition to the crucial concern of climate change, there are important lessons in the formation of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. The first is a message of hope: that our representatives reveal themselves to be decent people committed to serving our nation and their constituents. While they are members of political parties, and often compete bitterly to win elections, they still agree that the best policies emerge from building consensus across political divides. The second lesson involves citizen engagement. Growth of the Climate Solutions Caucus has had crucial help from citizens encouraging their representatives, regardless of party, to take action on the issue of climate change. Our democracy is truly participatory, and we make it better when we speak up about issues which concern us. The changing politics of the issue of climate change, and particularly the involvement of conservatives, is due to engagement by leaders such as George Shultz and Michael Bloomberg, as well as by constituents like all of us, making elected officials aware of our concern, and asking them to act on the issue of climate change. So, let's celebrate the recent action of Reps. Schakowsky and Upton in joining the Climate Solutions Caucus. We should be grateful to all its members for their courage and leadership on climate change. Let's also recognize that this is only an important first step; there's much more work to be done on climate change. Our representatives should receive our gratitude when they make Congress work, and they will need the steady and determined encouragement of citizens as they move toward drafting and passing bipartisan climate legislation.

The Prospect Heights Natural Resources Commission and the Prospect Heights Public Library are co-sponsoring an educational program titled "Restoring in the Face of Climate Change" at 7 p.m. Thursday, June 25, through the library's Zoom platform. Instructions for logging into the program will be emailed to registrants on the day of the program. 
Climate change is affecting our everyday life as well as the ecosystems surrounding us and the organisms that live in them. At the same time, people are realizing all the benefits natural areas provide, including carbon storage, as a way of combating climate change The presentation will be given by Izabella Redlinski, a conservation ecologist at the Field Museum's Keller Science Action Center working in the greater Chicago Wilderness area and concentrating many of her efforts in the Calumet region. Redlinski works to conserve high quality remnant habitats and species that reside within them, as well as bring back the health and resilience to those areas that have heavily been affected by urban sprawl and industrial development. She spends a lot of time thinking about restoration efforts, nature in an urban setting, what specific techniques can be used to pre-adapt conservation efforts to climate change and what collective and individual actions we can take to ameliorate the effects of it. Nature Speaks is a partnership between Prospect Heights Natural Resources Commission and the Prospect Heights Public Library. The program is free; register at www.phpl.info.

Record U.K. flooding: Latest symptom of El Nino, climate change? -BYLN- By Chelsea Harvey The Washington Post
Chicago Daily Herald

December witnessed a spate of extreme global weather events, from deadly tornadoes in the southern U.S. to bushfires in Australia - and the latest development is a series of record-breaking floods in the United Kingdom, brought on by torrential rain starting in the first week of the month.
Thousands of homes in the north of England are believed to have been affected already, and the region is reeling again from a new wave of flooding just brought in this week with the onset of Storm Frank.
There's been much discussion about the causes behind the surprising rash of winter storms in the region (Frank is the third major storm to hit within a month), and equal suspicion has fallen on the effects of climate change and the influences of this year's particularly potent El Nino event. It can be difficult to parse exactly what's going on, though.
Nicola Maxey, a press officer from the Met Office (the U.K.'s national weather service), noted in an email to The Washington Post that it was too early to say for sure whether climate change was a major contributor to this winter's extreme rainfall - but added that evidence from both physics and the study of weather systems suggests that it may have played a part.
The Met Office, in fact, recently published a report in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society examining the causes behind dozens of extreme weather events in 2014, including similarly severe rainfall in the U.K. in the winter of 2013/2014. Using models, the report concluded that anthropogenic climate change likely had a hand in the extreme conditions that winter - the highest rainfall since 1931 - and that climate change increases the chances of extreme rainfall during a time period of 10 consecutive winter days by a factor of seven.
So while scientists frequently warn that individual weather events can't always be considered an indicator of long-term climatic patterns, the research in this case suggests that climate change is increasing the odds of extreme winter weather events in the UK. This is in keeping with research from all over the world that suggests that extreme weather, in general, is likely to increase in frequency and intensity all around the world as a result of climate change.
"I think it is fair to conclude that human-caused climate change here too increased the flooding potential of the recent storms," said Michael Mann, distinguished professor of meteorology at Penn State University, in an email to The Post. "While climate change didn't 'cause' the storms themselves, it has increased the potential for heavy rainfall and flooding with these storms."
On the other hand, Maxey pointed out that El Nino, which increases the likelihood of warmer and wetter winters in the U.K., could also be at play in the recent events - but she added that it's "just one of many drivers that affect the UK weather and there are many other factors which could override this signal."
So parsing between the two - human-caused climate change, on the one hand, and naturally occurring El Nino, on the other - can seem confusing. But experts are increasingly arguing that the U.K. downpours - along with many of the other unusual weather events being witnessed around the globe as 2015 came to a close - are likely the product of both forces interacting and ultimately making each other worse.
El Nino itself is not a product of climate change at all. Rather, it's a naturally occurring cycle, coming around every four to seven years or so, that brings unusually warm temperatures to the Pacific Ocean, generally with significant consequences for global weather patterns. This year's is believed to be among the strongest El Nino events ever recorded.
Because its effects are often similar to those predicted to be caused by climate change, including unseasonably warm temperatures in some regions and an increase in storms and other extreme weather events, it can be hard to definitively say which events are caused by which phenomenon. In fact, the claim that certain extreme weather events are the product of El Nino, and not human-caused climate change, is sometimes seized upon by climate doubters arguing that increases in extreme weather patterns are simply the product of naturally occurring processes.
However, this doesn't change the fact that climate change is a continuous process that's still happening even in El Nino years. What's more likely, given the severity of this season's event and the strange weather that's accompanied it, is that the ongoing influence of climate change is simply making this year's El Nino event even worse.

Energy from pig slurry helps fight climate change
Chicago Daily Herald

STERKSEL, Netherlands - The 2,700 pigs on the farm that John Horrevorts manages yield more than ham and bacon. A biogas plant makes enough electricity from their waste to run the farm and feeds extra wattage into the Dutch national grid.
He even gets bonus payments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
As the world struggles to reduce pollution causing climate change, attention has focused on the burning of fossil fuels in factories, power stations, and vehicles. But U.N. scientists says farming and forestry account for more than 30 percent of the greenhouse gases that are gradually heating the earth. Much of that pollution comes from cattle, sheep and pigs that belch or excrete methane, a heat-trapping gas more than 20 times as potent as carbon dioxide, the most common global warming gas.
Negotiators from 190 countries have been working to reach a new climate change agreement in December on ways to reduce emissions and help countries adapt to changes in climate. They will reconvene June 1 in Bonn, Germany, for another two-week session.
Yet it is uncertain whether cutting agricultural emissions will be part of the agreement expected to emerge at the final meetings in Copenhagen, Denmark. The subject is complex, emissions are difficult to measure, and the whole question is politically sensitive, touching on the distrust between the world's rich and poor countries.
Scientists say it is too important to be left out.
"It would be absolutely nuts to ignore agriculture and forestry in any future climate deal," said Pete Smith, professor of soils and global change at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.
U.N. studies say agriculture is the main source of income for one of every three working people. It also is a growing source of pollution, as the global population increases and living standards rise in developing countries where more people are eating meat.
The latest research by the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization says animal husbandry accounts for 18 percent of all greenhouse gases, when taking into account the grassland and forests that are cleared for raising livestock.
When the FAO report came out in 2006, "people in the livestock sector were shocked because they thought they did a good job," says Akke van der Zijpp, a professor of animal husbandry at Wageningen University, a premier Dutch technical facility. Now they "are becoming slowly aware that this problem has to be solved."
One way to deal with it is to reduce the methane animals produce by changing their diet or through breeding.
Another is to make use of it and burn it.
Horrevorts says Wageningen University's Praktijkcentrum, or Sterksel Research Center, creates 5,000 megawatts a year, enough to power 1,500 homes. The farm uses the electricity it needs and feeds the rest into the national grid, for which the government pays up to euro177 ($238) per megawatt as a green energy subsidy.
Pigs can be remarkably housebroken animals. Here, they drop their waste through slats on the floor in the middle of the barn while spending most of their time in open stalls to the side. The slurry is channeled into three 4,000 cubic meter (141,250 cubic feet) tanks, then mixed into a thick goo with other organic waste like low-quality grain and carrot juice to increase the methane potential. Bacteria break down the material in a digester tank and the gas is siphoned off into a generator to produce electricity.
Horrevorts says a group including his operation and four other commercial farms avoids methane emissions equivalent to 40,000 tons of carbon a year. Dozens of private or nonprofit companies known as offset providers will "buy" those tons as a way of supporting renewable energy or other projects that reduce carbon emissions, then resell the credits to individuals or companies who want to shrink their carbon footprint.
Last year, Horrevorts said, a British offset provider paid euro5 ($6.70) per ton for people wanting to neutralize plane travel or rock concert tickets. This year, the farm was negotiating with a Dutch company seeking to become carbon neutral to promote a green image.
Though operating expenses for the biogas plant are considerable, the combination of electricity savings, power production and carbon credits makes it profitable, Horrevorts says.
Horrevorts, who is a biological researcher rather than a professional farmer, says that with financial incentives through electricity subsidies, it could become standard practice for ordinary farmers. About 50 commercial biogas plants operate on farms in the Netherlands, and the practice is spreading across industrial livestock farms around the world.
"I think in the future every pig farm will have a biogas plant," he says.
But at euro1 million ($1.3 million) for a big plant like Sterksel's, it's a rich man's answer to climate change. About 70 percent of the world's agriculture is on small land holdings in the developing world, which complicates climate politics, says Antonio Hill of the nonprofit group Oxfam International.
"It sounds like a big pot," Hill said, but dealing with farming is tougher than with industries. "You're talking about tens of thousands of sources of industrial emissions in rich countries. That's a lot more manageable than hundreds of millions of agricultural operations."

Dave Lowe found measurable proof of climate change 50 years ago. He's watched in horror ever since. Lowe

There's a certificate on the wall of Dave Lowe's small cottage in Petone, Wellington, New Zealand. It could easily be missed by a passing guest. But if they cared to take a second glance, three words would immediately jump out: Nobel Peace Prize. It's the 2007 Prize, awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Lowe was a lead author on their largest-ever report. 
It was by far the greatest honor of his career. He resigned almost immediately afterward, walking away on top of the scientific world. The Prize is a testament to all that he has achieved in his career, but to him, it's a haunting reminder of all the things he didn't, or couldn't, change. "I've lived this horror for 50 years," he says. "There's so little time left and we've just been so bloody stupid." Dave Lowe was one of the first people on Earth to find measurable proof that human activities were changing the atmosphere and warming the planet. For the past 50 years, he has watched on, helpless and frustrated, as the situation around him has gotten worse, and worse, and worse. Volcano over clouds The world's largest volcano dominates the skyline of Hawaii's Big Island. The huge, sloping sides and gigantic crater of Mauna Loa cast an imposing shadow and send a constant warning across the Pacific paradise. The Ancient Hawaiians believed Mauna Loa was created by the volcano goddess Pele, who formed it at such an immense height so she could escape the wrath of her sister Namaka, the sea goddess. According to one legend, Pele is accompanied by a phantom white dog. When an eruption was soon to occur, she would send her dog down the mountain to warn the people of the impending disaster. In 1958, an American scientist named Charles David Keeling climbed Mauna Loa, and changed the world's understanding of our climate forever. Keeling had spent the better part of the 1950s perfecting a system of measuring exactly how much of which gases make up Earth's atmosphere. By adapting gas analyzers used in coal mines, he was able to take the first reliable reading of the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. It was here, in two simple gray buildings set against a desolate, otherworldly landscape, that Keeling established the world's first permanent station to measure CO2 levels. The gas analyzer splits a sample of air into 1 million parts, and counts how many of those are CO2. The first measurement Keeling took read 313 parts per million. Then, as he continued to take regular readings, he saw something no one had ever seen before. The planet was breathing. In autumn, as the leaves died off the trees, the amount of CO2 in the air would rise. Then in spring, as the plants grew again, the number would fall again. In and out, like lungs exhaling. Then, when a full year had gone by and the cycle was complete, he checked the number again. It never returned to 313. Now, it sat at 314 ppm. He had just uncovered the first piece of evidence that the total amount of CO2 in the air was increasing. That matters because CO2 has an insulating effect in the atmosphere. It traps heat, which is why it's called a greenhouse gas. More CO2 means more heat. Every year without fail, for the last 61 years, the number has continued to climb. The chart that tracks the rising CO2, that drumbeat on the march to climate breakdown, is called the Keeling Curve. Some would say that the legends of Mauna Loa are true. Pele's white dog has become Keeling's gas analyzer, high in the mountains among the ancient volcanic rock, sending out a warning signal to tell the people of the coming disaster. A worldwide search While Keeling was tracking the first evidence of climate change on a Hawaiian volcano, Dave Lowe was a teenage high school dropout in Taranaki, New Zealand, with only one thing on this mind: surfing. "You go out there and man, do you get a feeling for the environment. I saw the atmosphere directly, going down into the ocean, mixing the sounds, the smells." Sitting on his board, staring out at the mist and the ocean spray dancing against the pink hues of the setting sun, he decided he needed to understand more about the world around him. He went back to school and earned a physics honors degree from Victoria University of Wellington. Lowe and Keeling's paths would cross for the first time in 1970. By this time, Keeling was a giant in his field. But he wasn't satisfied with his research station at Mauna Loa. One measurement at one specific location wasn't enough evidence. He wanted a global record, in both hemispheres, so he could confirm what he was seeing, and track it for future decades. Lowe was a 23-year-old graduate at the former Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, recruited to join Keeling's team as they set up the world's second continuous record of atmospheric CO2. They found a spot about 30 minutes out of Wellington city, near Makara Beach, at the World War II-era gun emplacements of Fort Opau. The first failed attempts to record atmospheric CO2 in New Zealand were made at Fort Opau, a gun emplacement built in 1941 to protect the Wellington harbor. After six months training in California, Lowe returned to join the small American team of one scientist and two technicians. But that work was for nothing. The readings at Makara were erratic, showing wild swings and no discernible pattern. They were useless. There was about a kilometer of paddocks between the sea and the analyzer that was sucking up too much CO2 and throwing off the readings. Keeling told him he needed to develop a new portable gas analyzer and find a new location, undisturbed by vegetation or outside sources. After some searching, Lowe found the spot he was looking for at Baring Head, a peninsula an hour out of Wellington in the opposite direction, at the base of the Remutaka Forest Park. It was perfect. At the right time, Baring Head gets air currents directly from Antarctica, an incredible undisturbed run through hundreds of kilometers of the Southern Ocean. The first thing they learned was that Baring Head always measured a few ppm behind Mauna Loa. The majority of emissions are produced in the northern hemisphere; this showed that it took time for those gases to spread south. They also found that Baring Head didn't show the same huge seasonal swings as the Mauna Loa readings. The huge continents of vegetation in the northern hemisphere were affecting the Hawaiian readings, but the measurements in the South Pacific, surrounded by ocean, were far more stable. Yet the most important thing was that in both the south and the north, the carbon in the atmosphere was slowly rising. Finding himself in charge of a groundbreaking research with barely any experience, Lowe put everything on his own shoulders. Together with his friend and colleague Peter Gunther, they were basically running the entire southern arm of the operation alone, and they were fully aware of how important their work was. That meant constant flights between Wellington and California, reading every background paper that had ever been written on the subject, developing all the computer programs to drive the calculations. "We worked our butts off," he says. "I knew that I just had to do this. I threw everything I had into it." But that intensity had its consequences. Eventually, something had to give. The single-minded drive Lowe had dedicated to his pursuit of science cost him his marriage. Proof or persuasion In 1975, Lowe took a sabbatical to recover from his professional and personal blowout. He attended the first scientific conference of greenhouse gas experts. He reckons he's probably the only person at the meeting who is still alive. The small group knew what was coming before anyone else in the world. They had proved that mankind was changing the chemical makeup of the air, and they knew the inevitable outcome of that. The terms "global warming" and "climate change" hadn't been invented yet, but that's exactly what they were seeing. In the following years, Lowe moved to Germany to study further, and met his now-wife Irena. They've been married for 40 years. He specialized in isotopic techniques, which he describes as like DNA tracing for gas particles. Not all the CO2 in the atmosphere is from the burning of fossil fuels. For most of human history, the CO2 level has naturally fluctuated between 200 and 300 ppm, which we know thanks to air samples trapped in glacier ice cores. Those natural fluctuations are often cited by climate deniers to suggest that climate change is not man-made. Naturally occurring carbon is made up of different isotopes. The most common types are called Carbon-12 and Carbon-13. Carbon-12 is by far the most common type found in nature. Carbon-13 makes up about 1% of the total. But the exact amount can differ. There is slightly less Carbon-13 in fossil fuels like coal and oil compared to in atmospheric carbon. Lowe and other international researchers found that while total CO2 in the air was increasing, the percentage of Carbon-13 isotopes compared to Carbon-12 was decreasing. That proved that the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was coming from the burning of fossil fuels by humans, not anything else. "That's the smoking gun. You can get every skeptic blue in the face, but that's just open and shut evidence that this extra CO2 came from humans," he says. That was proof, settled science. But the battle to convince the public of his findings was only just beginning. Part of the problem was that the predicted temperature rise didn't show up for several years. While CO2 was rising, the mercury was jumping up and down, with no consistency. But eventually, the signal separated from the noise and the heat started to climb. Once it did, it basically never stopped. In hindsight, the conservative approach of the scientific community probably held progress back for a number of years, he says. "It was a totally different time. If only I knew then what I know now ... Now it's different. Many of us are out there doing stuff. We have to. This is an emergency." * This is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalistic collaboration to strengthen coverage of the climate story.

A priority in the voting booth We must elect leaders at every level who are prepared to deal with climate change

Last in a series We got into a conversation the other day with a friend who, in reference to Friday's climate change protests around the globe, asked, "I wonder how many climate marchers there are in China today? Answer: zero." The answer to that frustration recalls a mother's venerable wisdom in response to her child's argument to stay out late because, well, Johnny's mom lets him stay out late: "If Johnny jumped off a cliff, would you jump off a cliff?"
 Whether China does or does not respond to the challenge of global warming, we each do what we can. We don't say there's no point if China doesn't address it. We do what we can. Every drop may not begin an ocean, but every ocean begins with a drop. While it's hard to pinpoint any single hurricane, forest fire, drought or glacier melt and attribute it categorically to the weather extremes wrought by global warming, the signs are all around us that we already are beginning to feel the effects of climate change. More disturbing, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year issued a report warning of catastrophe as early as 2040 if governments around the world don't aggressively address the challenge. It is irresponsible for any politician to ignore the data and play into the wishes of short-term vested interests and the wishful thinking of climate change doubters. The stakes and the obligations, for us and for our posterity, are too high. As anyone who watches the early dust-ups of the 2020 presidential politicking is well aware, we are beginning the campaigns for next year's elections. Soon candidates will begin appearing not just for president, but also for the Senate and U.S. House. There will be candidates on the ballot for the Illinois General Assembly and county offices and an assortment of other offices. We're generally not litmus-test voters. Elected office holders face myriad important issues and every candidate is a combination views; most will have at least a few positions worthy of question or criticism. Because of that, we tend to view candidates based less on one specific issue and more on the ways their minds work, the independence they display, and the summary and depths of the allegiances they hold. Not in 2020. Each of us, as voters, must demand a position on climate change from the candidates who solicit our support. And not just a position, but a plan. What do the candidates intend to do about it? This applies to all candidates. A president will have more power and impact on climate change than, say, a county board member. But counties must respond to climate challenges as well as nations. In order to truly serve, every public servant must be giving constructive attention to this issue. Views on climate change are not the sole prerequisite voters should require of the candidates in next year's elections. But they are the first. Without an appropriate response on it, a candidate's response on any other issue doesn't matter. As individuals, we often ask ourselves what can we do to combat climate change. One of the most important things we can do is to make it a priority in the 2020 elections.

Climate change forum: WGN-TV and radio meteorologist Tom Skilling is one of the panelists at a forum Saturday, July 13, on climate change, hosted by Congressmen Bill Foster and Sean Casten at 10 a.m. at Wentz Hall at North Central College, 171 E. Chicago Ave. in Naperville. Other panelists are Mary Gade, president of Gade Environmental Group; Doug Sisterson, a climate scientist from Argonne National Laboratory; and Paul Bloom, associate professor of physics at North Central. 
Parking deck repairs: Naperville will begin maintenance work next week on the Van Buren Parking Deck at 43 W. Van Buren St. as part of its downtown parking deck maintenance program. Work will take place in three phases and is expected to take six weeks. The city has contracted with F.H. Paschen to repair the deck joints and replace the sealants on the fourth level of the deck. Additional work will include maintenance to the rooftop stairway/elevator vestibules and fifth-floor door and window frames to prevent water from leaking through to the lower decks, which contributes to deterioration of the structure. Crews will work from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays. Portions of the third and fourth floor will be inaccessible during the first two phases. The fourth floor will be completely closed and inaccessible during the third phase, which is expected to begin Aug. 12. Unless otherwise noted, all levels of the parking deck will be re-opened and available for use on Saturdays and Sundays. Visit naperville.il.us/downtownparking. DuPage Woodworkers: DuPage Woodworkers will hold its annual auction on Saturday, July 20, at St. James the Apostle Church, 480 S. Park Blvd., Glen Ellyn. Registration begins at 8 a.m. with the auction starting promptly at 9 a.m. It generally features a selection of hand tools, power tools and supplies. Bring items related to woodworking (used tools you no longer want, a piece of maple that didn't fit into your last project, etc.) or just come to bid. It is suggested that small items be bundled as one lot. This year, they will sell six items for each seller and then move to the next seller. Sellers will be able to prioritize the order of sale. There will be one or two more rounds after the first one so you can bring more than six items to sell. Sellers must be a member of a woodworking club. For auction rules, click on the Newsletter link at dupagewoodworkers.org.

Trump on climate change evidence: 'People like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence but we're not necessarily such believers.'

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed a landmark report compiled by 13 federal agencies detailing how damage from global warming is intensifying throughout the country, saying he is not among the "believers" who see climate change as a pressing problem. The comments marked the president's most extensive yet on why he disagrees with his own government's analysis, which found that climate change poses a severe threat to the health of Americans, as well as to the country's infrastructure, economy and natural resources. The findings - unequivocal, urgent and alarming - are at odds with the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations and absence of any climate action policy. "One of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence but we're not necessarily such believers," Trump said during a freewheeling 20-minute Oval Office interview with The Washington Post in which he was asked why he was skeptical of the dire National Climate Assessment his administration released Friday. "As to whether or not it's man-made and whether or not the effects that you're talking about are there, I don't see it," he added. 
Trump did not address the fundamental cause of climate change. The president riffed on pollution in other parts of the world. He talked about trash in the oceans. He opined on forest management practices. But he said little about what scientists say is actually driving the warming of the planet - emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. "You look at our air and our water and it's right now at a record clean. But when you look at China and you look at parts of Asia and you look at South America, and when you look at many other places in this world, including Russia, including many other places, the air is incredibly dirty, and when you're talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very small," Trump said in an apparent reference to pollution around the globe. "And it blows over and it sails over. I mean we take thousands of tons of garbage off our beaches all the time that comes over from Asia. It just flows right down the Pacific. It flows and we say, 'Where does this come from?' And it takes many people, to start off with." Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, said in an email Tuesday that the president's comments risk leaving the nation vulnerable to the ever-growing impacts of a warming planet. "Facts aren't something we need to believe to make them true - we treat them as optional at our peril," Hayhoe said. "And if we're the president of the United States, we do so at the peril of not just ourselves but the hundreds of millions of people we're responsible for." Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, struggled to find a response to the president's comments. "How can one possibly respond to this?" Dessler said when reached by email, calling the president's comments "idiotic" and saying Trump's main motivation seemed to be attacking the environmental policies of the Obama administration and criticizing political adversaries. In his comments, Trump also seemed to invoke a theme that is common in the world of climate-change skepticism - the idea that not so long ago, scientists feared global cooling, rather than the warming that is underway today. "If you go back and if you look at articles, they talk about global freezing," Trump said. "They talk about at some point, the planet is going to freeze to death, then it's going to die of heat exhaustion." This may refer to an oft-cited 1975 Newsweek article titled "The Cooling World" or a 1974 Time magazine story titled "Another Ice Age?" But researchers who have reviewed this period have found that while such ideas were indeed afoot at the time, there was "no scientific consensus in the 1970s" about a global cooling trend or risk, as there is today about human-caused climate change. In other words, scientists' understanding of where the planet is headed, and the consequences, is far more developed now than it was in the 1970s. At present, Earth has warmed roughly one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above late-19th-century, preindustrial levels. Multiple analyses have shown that without rapid emissions cuts - well beyond what the world is undertaking - the warming will continue and could blow past key thresholds that scientists say could lead to irrevocable climate-related catastrophes, such as more-extreme weather, the death of coral reefs and losses of major parts of planetary ice sheets. On Tuesday, a U.N. report underscored again how the world is far off course on its promises to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. The report found that, with global emissions still increasing as of 2017, it is unlikely they will peak by 2020. Scientists have said that carbon emissions must fall sharply in coming years if the world is to have a chance of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change. Trump also made reference to recent devastating wildfires in California, which scientists say have been made more intense and deadly by climate change. But the president instead focused on how the forests that burned have been managed. Previously, he has praised Finland for spending "a lot of time on raking and cleaning" its forest floors - a notion that left the Finnish president flummoxed. "The fire in California, where I was, if you looked at the floor, the floor of the fire, they have trees that were fallen," Trump said. "They did no forest management, no forest maintenance, and you can light - you can take a match like this and light a tree trunk when that thing is laying there for more than 14 or 15 months. And it's a massive problem in California." "You go to other places where they have denser trees, it's more dense, where the trees are more flammable, they don't have forest fires like this because they maintain," he said. "And it was very interesting I was watching the firemen, and they were raking brush ... It's on fire. They're raking it, working so hard. If that was raked in the beginning, there would be nothing to catch on fire." Trump wasn't the only administration official on Tuesday to continue shrugging off the federal government's latest climate warnings. In a television appearance in California, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke acknowledged that fire seasons have grown longer in the state but added, "Climate change or not, it doesn't relieve you of responsibility to manage the forest." Meanwhile, asked Tuesday about the findings of the nearly 1,700-page climate report the administration released on Black Friday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders echoed her boss. "We think that this is the most extreme version and it's not based on facts," Sanders said of the National Climate Assessment. "It's not data-driven. We'd like to see something that is more data-driven. It's based on modeling, which is extremely hard to do when you're talking about the climate. Again, our focus is on making sure we have the safest, cleanest air and water."

Reflections on dealing with climate change

Invest in technology for energy storage The National Audubon Society recently released a new report, Survival by Degrees: 389 Species on the Brink. It shows that more than three quarters of bird species in North America are vulnerable to extinction due to a rise in temperature, changes in weather patterns, and the dwindling or loss of vital habitats. Of course, these climate changes will not only affect birds but eventually every form of life on our planet. Here in Illinois that means birds such as the redheaded woodpecker, scarlet tanager, and the bobolink will be threatened. In order to slow climate change and give birds like the redheaded woodpecker a fighting chance, we need to quickly reduce our carbon emissions. 
The good news is that our science also shows that if we take action now we can improve the chances for the majority (76%) of species at risk from climate change. Our birds are telling us that it's time to act now. Right now, Congress is considering a bill that would help us switch from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy sources, thus creating a healthier environment for all. This bill is called the Better Energy Storage Technology (BEST) Act of 2019, which would strengthen the electric grid and is a critical step to making renewable energy available around the clock. Many thanks to Congressman Brad Schneider for co-sponsoring HR 2986. I urge our congressmen to also support energy storage legislation like the BEST Act. This will help address the underlying causes of climate change in order to protect birds and the places that we need now and into the future. Emma England, President Lake County Audubon Society New recording stations show no warming I've got some great news for Ashley Staat. Having read her recent letter to the Daily Herald, I'm sure this news will come as a great relief to her, and that is, there has been no warming in the United States since at least 2005. I expect a great many will give a huge sigh of relief to hear that. And who do we get to thank for this news? NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and their newly (as of 2005) installed temperature recording stations all across the United States. The raw data (aka, empirical data) shows no significant increase in temps nationally since at least the year these sensors were turned on (2005). If warming is a concern, and higher levels of atmospheric CO2 are considered the cause of this warming, then perhaps we should rethink that cause-effect relationship. CO2 levels are high right now, but these elevated levels have not produced an increase in temps in our country for about 14 years, and perhaps even longer. This makes me consider the possibility that all these natural weather events are just that: natural. Also, this so-called "100% Clean Economy Act," well, is this a just a play on words to entice those who have not researched the implications? For instance, wind and solar are pushed as the answer to all our energy woes. Clean energy, don't you know? But ... ah, there's always a "but," isn't there? But, wind generators and solar panels need to be manufactured. That means raw materials are needed to build them, which in turn means mining for the required materials. Some of the most critical materials are coming from overseas nowadays. Rare earth metals are required for some of this manufacturing and "are used in many devices that people use every day such as computer memory, DVDs, rechargeable batteries, cellphones, catalytic converters, magnets, fluorescent lighting and much more." Solar cells and generators are among that "much more" by the way. And where do the bulk of these rare earth metals come from? China. Food for thought, eh? John Babush Big Rock Legislation benefits poor, middle class President Obama is correct that to address climate change, we must consider economic inequality. That is why the Energy Innovation Act, currently introduced to Congress, is progressive legislation that fights climate change while benefiting the poor and middle class economically. This legislation charges fossil fuel producers a rising fee for the fossil fuels they mine from the earth. This rising fee gets passed on to other corporations and to individuals, encouraging everyone to seek lower-carbon alternatives. But all of the money collected from the fee is distributed to individual American households via a dividend. Low- and middle-income households receive more money from the dividend than the pay in higher costs. This means that this policy would drive down carbon emissions while giving extra money to those who need it most. Studies have demonstrated that this policy would decrease carbon emissions by 40% in 10 years and by 90% in the next 30 years. To address climate change through progressive legislation, we should support the Energy Innovation & Carbon Dividend Act, HR 763. Jim Schwartz Oak Park Animal Control agency taking important step I am writing in response to the article titled Kane County Animal Control now solar powered, published in the Daily Herald on Nov. 20.It's great to hear that Kane County Animal Control is going to make use of solar energy. I think it's a source of energy that is often under-appreciated and not exercised to its full potential. The initial cost of installing the panels may be a financial decision that a company or business doesn't want to make at first, but in this case, it seems to be paying off early for KCAC. What interests me here is how the long-term sustainability of the panels will hold up. Hearing that the potential savings earned now and in the long run are going to benefit the animals is also incredibly positive. With carbon dioxide emissions on the decline throughout the country, arguably the best news is hearing that Kane County is doing something to contribute further to fewer greenhouse gas emissions. It's great to hear that our community is going "greener" nowadays and hopefully the efforts from Kane County Animal Control will encourage other local businesses to consider doing, or to just do, the same thing down the road leading to 2040. Jordan G. Simal Schaumburg Taking it seriously Sean Casten's participation in the UN Climate Change Conference deserves more notice than it received. Though it was overshadowed by the ongoing impeachment drama, the climate conference dealt with an issue that is far more important in the long term, and that cannot be resolved without American involvement. Congressman Casten, along with Nancy Pelosi and other US representatives, went to Madrid to show the world that, despite the Trump administration's nonsensical policies, most Americans take climate change seriously. This sort of statement is essential. The more damage Trump and his followers do to our country's strength and reputation, the more we need other voices who can assure our allies that we haven't forgotten our obligations to the rest of the world. Centuries from now, our descendants won't talk about Donald Trump, but they will talk about the environment, and whether or not we allowed it to fall into ruin. The 6th District is fortunate to have a representative who can take a leadership role in this all-important effort. Devin McCrate West Dundee

Since retiring from her practice of corporate law, Alisa Singer, founder of Environmental Graphiti, has devoted herself to creating art that furthers the causes she believes are important.
With climate change being one such cause, Singer conceived the Environmental Graphiti project in 2014 and created The Art of Climate Change, a series of abstract images derived from the science behind the critical changes affecting the planet. Brushwood Center is welcoming this art series to the Brushwood Gallery with an opening reception from 1-3 p.m. June 11. The reception is free and no registration is required.
Singer was attracted by the inherently aesthetic design elements of scientific charts and graphs and intrigued by the idea of using art to give them dramatic effect. Each of Singer's vibrant digital paintings is printed on metal and uses a graph, chart, map, word, or number relating to a key fact about climate change as its "blueprint."
Using a wild array of bold colors, she turns science into art to dramatize the compelling facts about what is happening to our world, connecting audiences to science and nature through the art she creates.
Environmental Graphiti delivers a message about climate change in a unique and powerful way. Singer says: "Art makes the science more accessible. Science makes the art more meaningful. They are a potent combination. Once viewers understand that each piece is derived from a key indicator or fact about climate change, they are intrigued and become more engaged with both the art and the underlying message."
To further enrich the dialogue between art and science that Environmental Graphiti has created, Brushwood Center has invited Field Museum Climate Change Ecologist Dr. Katherine Moore Powell to speak.
Dr. Moore Powell has studied the ecology and hydrology of wetlands in Florida and the effect of changing seasonal rain patterns on carbon and water cycling in grasslands in Colorado, and is now developing a climate change adaptation plan for the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.
Her June 11 talk, "The Faces Behind the Graphs," will explore the people behind the research that supports climate change.
Although there are decades of research and thousands of publications behind the data that support climate change research, there is usually little known about the people who have worked so hard to study the Earth and its many complex systems. Their stories will parallel the story of climate change and the inspiration for the art.
Environmental Graphiti creates a dialogue at the intersection of art, nature, and science - a perfect fit for the gallery at Brushwood Center, where the mission is to promote the importance of nature for nurturing personal and community well-being, cultivating creativity, and inspiring learning. The show will run June 11 through July 31.
For more information, visit www.brushwoodcenter.org/Programs/Art/ArtExhibitions/EnvironmentalGraphi ti.html.
Brushwood Center is at 21850 N. Riverwoods Road, Riverwoods.

Climate change is real, and it's happening now. The good news is that solutions exist. But we must act decisively, and soon.
There is a lot of denial and intentional misinformation about this issue. But it's happening, whether or not we want to believe it. To help raise awareness, a group of dedicated folks are engaged in The Great March for Climate Action. They began March 1 in Los Angeles and are walking across the country to Washington, D.C. The marchers will be in Chicago on Sept. 6. More information is online, or look up Chicago Climate March on Facebook.
There will be another important climate march in New York City on Sept. 21. This event, called the People's Climate March, is intended to show the United Nations that there is support for serious action on climate change now. My wife and I have already booked our train tickets, and I expect tens of thousands to be there.
This problem is real, and very important. We cannot wait any longer to act. Please join the local march or the national event to show your support for action now on climate change.

Obama: Climate change already damaging parks

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. - President Barack Obama said Saturday that climate change is already damaging America's national parks, with rising temperatures causing Yosemite's meadows to dry out and raising the prospect of a glacier preserve without its glaciers someday.
"Make no mistake. Climate change is no longer just a threat. It's already a reality," Obama said from a podium, with Yosemite Falls, one of the world's tallest at 2,425 feet, as a backdrop.
At the California park, where Obama was spending the weekend with his wife, Michelle, and daughters Malia and Sasha, the president also talked about how a rabbit-like animal known as a pika is being forced further upslope at Yosemite to escape the heat.
"Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers at Glacier National Park. No more Joshua trees at Joshua Tree National Park," he said, adding that a changing climate could destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades and threaten such landmarks as Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.
Obama spoke near Yosemite's Sentinel Bridge, where views of Half Dome, a well-known rock formation in the park, and Yosemite Falls created a picturesque background behind him under a sunny, blue sky.
After a night with his family in a rented cabin in the popular park, Obama stuck to his usual routine by rising early Saturday and heading to a recreation center on the grounds for his daily gym workout.
Obama's weekend in the great outdoors was planned to encourage more people to appreciate and visit many of the nation's parks. The National Park Services manages more than 400 sites around the country and celebrates its centennial in August.

Robert Kenner battles climate-change deniers with 'Merchants of Doubt'

Robert Kenner battles climate-change deniers with 'Merchants of Doubt'
WASHINGTON - In Washington, everyone's always pushing something.
There's Robert Kenner, sitting in the private banquet room of a Georgetown hotel, in front of a poster for his new documentary "Merchants of Doubt," which he has come to town, he says, to "sell." That choice of words is fitting. Kenner's movie - a follow-up to the filmmaker's acclaimed, Oscar-nominated "Food, Inc." - is all about marketing.
Unlike that 2008 film, which took on the machinery of American agribusiness and its trafficking in junk food, "Merchants of Doubt" isn't about a product that you can buy at the store. Rather, Kenner says, it's about something less tangible if no less bad for you, should you swallow it. It's sold in courtrooms and the halls of Congress, he says, on television and, occasionally, in newspapers.
Call it confusion, mislabeled as clarity.
The germ of Kenner's latest project, a simultaneously entertaining and inciting expose of professional charlatanism - practiced, most saliently, by those hired to make the case that global warming isn't real, or at least that there is no scientific consensus on it - sprouted in the director's head during the making of "Food, Inc."
"I went to a hearing on whether we should label cloned meat," Kenner recalls. "There was someone there who stood up and said, 'I think it would be way too confusing, for the consumer, to give them that kind of information.' I thought, 'I've never heard something like that before.' It was the representative of some meat company. I looked up and thought, 'Who could this be?'"
Kenner can no longer remember the speaker's name or affiliation. But since starting work on "Merchants of Doubt," a film based on Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway's 2010 history of corporate baloney peddlers, running from Big Tobacco to climate-change denial, he has met a lot of folks just like that guy.
"It takes a lot of ... talent to do that," says Kenner, pausing before the word "talent" just long enough to make a reporter think he's about to say "cojones."
He isn't being entirely ironic. Kenner, 65, does admire people such as Marc Morano, a professional climate-change denier and founder of the Climate Depot website who is, arguably, the star of Kenner's film. After a stint in the 1990s reporting for Rush Limbaugh, Morano worked briefly as a flack for Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., who famously called global warming a "hoax."
These days, Morano most often pops up on TV shows arguing against the science of climate change. In front of Kenner's camera, Morano makes for a jocular - and weirdly unapologetic - advocate for what can only be called ignorance.
"I'm not a scientist," he jokes, flashing a huge, telegenic grin, "but I play one on TV."
He also plays dirty. In "Doubt," Morano recounts with glee how he has published the email addresses of climate scientists, subjecting them to intimidation and flaming attacks from anonymous critics. (Several of the abusive emails are read aloud in the film by their recipients, in an evocation of Jimmy Kimmel's "Celebrities Read Mean Tweets" segments.) It makes for a semi-serious tone that masks Kenner's more sobering message: We're routinely being lied to, by people who are darn good at it.
As depressing as this may sound, Kenner hopes that "Doubt" will be received by audiences as more than a muckraking investigation of snake oil salesmen. "Hopefully," he says, "I'm selling entertainment, as well. I didn't want to make medicine."
What he does want to make is change.
The director's "Food, Inc." reputation may help. Although he doesn't have the name recognition of, say, Michael Moore, Kenner's earlier film cut across ideological boundaries. After all, everybody has to eat. Kenner takes pleasure in pointing out the irony of right-wing publisher Rupert Murdoch handing out 70,000 free DVD copies of "Food, Inc." with his Sunday London Times in 2010.
At the same time, Kenner claims that he isn't trying to convert anyone; he's trying to reveal the hidden agendas of those who are. "People don't like to be lied to," he says.
There are a few recovering global-warming skeptics featured in "Doubt." Most notable among them is the staunchly Republican former congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina, who lost a 2010 re-election bid after acknowledging, in a radio interview, that he had come to believe in human-caused climate change. Like a prophet without honor in his own home, Inglis is shown preaching the gospel of climate change, to the derision of some of his former supporters.
But Kenner doesn't care that other global-warming deniers are unlikely to buy a ticket to his film, let alone be converted by it.
He is optimistic that the last vestiges of climate resistance will one day be swept away, likening it to the sea change that has occurred over the last several years in popular attitudes about same-sex marriage and other once-contentious issues.
"Look at gay rights," he says. "That was a set-in-stone issue, not only with right-wingers, but with liberals too, as recently as 2008. Marijuana is another." Tribes sometimes do get up and move, no matter how entrenched.
But he doesn't believe that butting heads with his most stubborn opponents will make it happen.
As Kenner sees it, on any issue, there are typically three groups: true believers; nonbelievers; and the vast, confused middle. It's not the middle's fault it's confused: Kenner blames the Marc Moranos of the world, who are paid to sow not just doubt but fear. ("Fear is a big part of it," he says.) The media share much of the blame. Kenner singles out newspapers - this one in particular - for his harshest criticism of what he calls their tradition of "false balance": the insistence on always presenting two sides of an issue, even when there aren't two.
"I think your paper is far less inclined to show deniers on the op-ed page these days," he says. "That's a big change, because they were being published continually. The fact is, that confused people, and that was a big part of the problem."
According to Kenner, change will come but not from those shouting at the edges of the argument. Rather, it will grow out of the confused middle, where films such as "Food, Inc." and "Merchants of Doubt" shine light on hidden, and uncomfortable, truths.
"You're never going to convert a third of the people right away," he says. "But as with the civil rights movement, you don't go to Bull Connor and say, 'Oh, you've got to change your mind.' You change the people around Bull Connor, and then Bull Connor has to change. You change the culture."

Dire news about climate change and its destruction of the environment seem to be the norm these days. Just this week, a new study showed global warming is shrinking glaciers 18 percent faster than scientists calculated in 2013. Eighteen-year-old environmental activist Xiuhtezcatl Martinez says that yes, facts are paramount, but it's essential to impart a more energizing message of engagement to spur change. "So much of the narrative of climate change is so destructive and it is not helpful in mobilizing and ... in creating impact," said Martinez, who serves as youth director of the Colorado-based organization Earth Guardians. "It's about adequately adjusting the urgency of the message while still making people feel they want to be invested in being part of the movement." 
In honor of Earth Month, Martinez will be in Elgin on April 17 to give a talk titled "Roots of Revolution" about getting involved at the grass-roots level in the climate change battle. "There's a lot of work that needs to be done in engaging people in the solution," he said. Despite his young age, Martinez is well-versed in the matter. He's been a climate activist since age 6, when his family was part of an effort to get their hometown of Boulder, Colorado, to take environmental action, such as to stop using pesticides in parks. Martinez has given TEDx talks and has been a guest on the HBO show "Real Time with Bill Maher." He was the keynote speaker at United Nations General Assembly's high-level climate change event in 2015 and was among the youngest speakers at the RIO+20 United Nations Summit in 2012. He's also among 21 youths who are suing the federal government, claiming people's constitutional rights are being violated in the failure to protect the planet from the effects of climate change. Martinez is a "once-in-a-generation kind of guy" whose impressive resume shows one person, even when young, can influence change, said Tia Aagesen, chairwoman of Elgin's sustainability commission, which sponsored the talk. "Our primary motivator (in inviting Martinez) is that he is a younger person, and we find that this generational engagement is really important not only to the commission but to the city," Aagesen said. Today's young people grow up surrounded by information about climate change, but can feel disenfranchised and unable to have a voice in the matter, Martinez said. Still, "young people are, time and time again, with and without my influence, actively jumping into the front lines for change," he added. "I think adults are jaded in a lot of places. It's easier for adults to be stuck in their ways than it is for young people," he said. People who want make individual changes to combat climate change should consider reducing or eliminating meat and dairy from their diets, because of the large carbon footprint produced by livestock, Martinez said. Eventually, the sum of all individual action shapes culture beyond climate policy or politics, he said. Martinez's talk is sponsored by Elgin's sustainability commission, which used $7,500 from its yearly budget to fund the event, city officials said. Doors open at 6 p.m. and the event is 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. April 17 at the Hemmens Cultural Center, 45 Symphony Way, Elgin. The event is free to the public but tickets are required for admission at cityofelgin.org/xtickets. * Daily Herald correspondent Jamie Greco contributed to this report.

Meteorologist Skilling, Rep. Foster make case for fighting climate change

A panel featuring WGN meteorologist Tom Skilling and physicist-turned-congressman Bill Foster told a supportive audience Saturday at North Central College that deniers of human-caused climate change are the equivalent of the people who caused thousands of deaths by denying the science on cigarettes decades ago.
Foster, a Naperville Democrat, helped organize the panel as President Donald Trump weighs a decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
The agreement set a new global standard for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The United States and China agreed to goals for 2025 to put the world on track to avoid a 3.6-degree-Fahrenheit increase in the global average temperature. Most climate scientists agree that increase would create environmental changes that would last for several lifetimes.
Skilling said changes already made by the Trump administration are "shocking and horrifying." They come as a result, he said, of people creating federal policy who have no background in climate science, much like the vast majority of the deniers of climate change he encounters.
"The information is out there," Skilling said. "Go to a credible source."
Skilling compared the doubts about climate change to the doubts from decades prior about cigarettes being bad for you.
"With climate change, they are taking uncertainty in the models and posing this as the fact that scientists don't understand how the atmosphere is working," Skilling said. "The average person says, 'You can't tell me tomorrow what the weather is going to do. How can you tell me what's going to happen in the next century or decades ahead?' Well, you can't tell a cigarette smoker if or when they are going to get cancer. But you know it's a dangerous endeavor. And we are seeing consequences already of the weather gone wild."
Skilling said the most recent example of climate change is the rampant flooding throughout the Midwest. Increased pockets of violent storms and tornadoes are also key indicators of warming causing increasing amounts of trapped moisture.
He also showed time-lapse videos of melting glaciers around the world.
"People say that the climate has always changed," Skilling said. "The changes happening now are happening at a rate 10 times faster than anything in the past."
Foster built off Skilling's cigarette analogy to explain why Congress has not fully embraced human responsibility for climate change.
"With cigarette smoking, it took decades for our government to respond because there was more on one side of the debate," Foster said. "That generates fake science and money to bribe politicians into not taking action. As a result, tens of thousands of people died needlessly."
He said people need to tell members of Congress from both sides of the aisle that it is not OK to ignore science.
Mary Gade, a former head of the Midwest region of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said pulling out of the Paris agreement will cause clean-energy jobs to go to other countries. France already is the leading producer of wind turbines, China the leader in solar panels. At risk are 85,000 Illinois jobs tied to clean energy, she said.
Trump is expected to make an announcement on the Paris agreement within the next week.

TODAY'S EXECUTIVE ORDER Rewriting climate policies Order: Climate change will no longer have to figure into decisions

Former President Barack Obama tried to integrate climate change into every facet of federal decision-making; President Donald Trump aims to undo much of that work.
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said Sunday on ABC's "This Week" that the executive order the president will sign today "will address the past administration's effort to kill jobs throughout the country through the Clean Power Plan," a reference to a regulation limiting greenhouse gases emitted by electric utilities. But it does much more than that.
What's in it:
* Instructions to the EPA to rewrite regulations restricting carbon emissions from both new and existing power plants. These two rules - particularly the one affecting existing plants, many of which are coal-fired - lie at the center of Obama's effort to curb the nation's carbon output. The limits on existing facilities aim to cut carbon pollution by about one-third by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and the rule subject to a pending lawsuit before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The order would instruct Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask the D.C. Circuit to hold the lawsuit in abeyance while EPA revises the rules, a process that will take more than a year and will inevitably face a court challenge.
* Lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing. Trump will direct the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management to lift the freeze on coal leasing on its land, which has been in effect since December 2015. In January, Interior proposed that the program guiding
coal exploration and production across 570 million publicly owned acres be updated to factor in the climate effect of such activities and provide a bigger return for U.S. taxpayers.
This will not have a major impact on domestic coal production, since the government has sold one set of coal leases since October 2012 and has estimated that it has already granted leases that are equivalent to a 20-year supply of coal.
But Pruitt told ABC that this and other policies in the order constitute "a promise to the American people - saying we can put people back to work and be pro-environment as well."
* Abolish federal guidance instructing agencies to incorporate climate change into federal decision-making. Obama ordered agencies to include climate change as a consideration when they conducted reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, a sweeping law that informed any federal decision that had a significant environmental impact. This will be eliminated outright.
* Jettison the Obama's administration's "social cost of carbon." The order would dissolve the task force that calculated what has become known as "the social cost of carbon" and revert to the 2003 standard used under the George W. Bush administration.
The current calculus, which is set at $36 per ton of carbon dioxide, aims to capture the negative consequences of allowing greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise and is applied to any regulations that have a climate impact.
* Promote oil and gas development on Interior's lands, including national wildlife refuges.
The order would make it easier to flare methane on oil and gas operations on federal land-in November the previous administration issued a rule curbing such "fugitive" emissions of the potent greenhouse gas, which the House has voted to overturn. It would also make it easier to conduct energy exploration on land managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
What's not in it:
* Language on the Paris climate agreement. The president's top advisers have been divided over whether the United States should formally withdraw from the 2015 global warming pact that Obama and his deputies helped broker through the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Under that accord, which has already entered into force, the United States voluntarily committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels in 2025, while making "best efforts" to reduce those emissions by 28 percent.
In his Sunday interview, Pruitt suggested that whether the United States opts out or remains in the agreement is unrelated to Tuesday's executive action.
"The Paris accord is nonbinding. It was not a treaty, as such. The Clean Power Plan is not tethered to the Paris accords," he said. "This is an effort to undo the unlawful approach the previous administration engaged in and do it right going forward with the mind set of being pro-growth and pro-environment."

EPA: Brace for climate change impacts

The Environmental Protection Agency published a 150-page document this past week with a straightforward message for coping with the fallout from natural disasters across the country: Start planning for the fact that climate change is going to make these catastrophes worse. The language, included in guidance on how to address the debris left in the wake of floods, hurricanes and wildfires, is at odds with the rhetoric of the EPA's own leader, Andrew Wheeler. Just last month, Wheeler said in an interview with CBS that "most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out." 
Multiple recent studies have identified how climate change is already affecting the United States and the globe. In the western United States, for example, regional temperatures have increased by almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1970s, and snowmelt is occurring a month earlier in areas, extending the fire season by three months and quintupling the number of large fires. Another scientific paper, co-authored by EPA researchers, found that unless the United States slashes carbon emissions, climate change will probably cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars annually by 2100. The divergence between Wheeler and his own agency offers the latest example of the often contradictory way that federal climate policy has evolved under President Donald Trump. As the White House has sought to minimize or ignore climate science, government experts have continued to sound the alarm. The president has said he intends to withdraw the nation from a key international climate accord, but last fall 13 agencies issued a report concluding that "the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans' physical, social, and economic well-being are rising." The White House has repeatedly sought ways to question the broad scientific consensus that human activities are driving climate change, and it is considering creating a federal advisory panel to reexamine those findings.

How cities are preparing to withstand climate change

Signs of climate change are all around us. Ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and extreme heat and other weather-related events are happening more frequently. A rising chorus of experts say getting ready for climate change catastrophes should include updating the infrastructure that helps keep cities and towns running across the globe. And we should be doing it right now. 
"We can't design based on the past anymore," says Constantine Samaras, who teaches civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. He points out that engineers and policymakers should focus on refurbishing infrastructure - buildings, highways, airports, dams, waste facilities and power grids - so that it's able to withstand new demands posed by the shifting climate. That means anticipating what people will need as well as new environmental stresses that climate change might heap on the existing system. Take, for example, the prediction that sea global sea levels might rise as much as 6 1/2 feet over the next century. With 90% of the world's urban areas located along bodies of water, steps need to be taken immediately to protect low-lying areas against flooding and raise or relocate coastal roadways, bridges and levees. And what about the effects of rising overall temperatures? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global temperatures could rise by 2 1/2 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. The situation is even more dire in cities, where acres of concrete absorb and retain dangerous levels of heat. Some U.S. cities already are taking steps. After the catastrophic flooding and wind damage caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, New York City invested $20 billion in dozens of measures meant to protect the city's 10 million residents against coastal storms that will only increase in frequency and intensity as the planet warms. New York shipped in 3.7 million cubic yards of sand to reinforce almost 10 miles of dunes along Coney Island. The rebuilt Rockaway Boardwalk, which was ripped to pieces by Sandy, was raised above the 100-year flood level and a concrete retaining wall underneath will act as a barrier against storm surges. Samaras also cites the Rockefeller Foundation's 100 Resilient Cities program, which helped popularize the new role of chief resilience officer in major cities worldwide. Since the program launched in 2013, nearly 100 global cities have published long-term resilience strategies with over 3,000 specific initiatives already funded. Paris, for example, is taking action against deadly heat waves like the 2003 tragedy that killed more than 700 Parisians. The Paris Resilience Strategy of 2017 looks to transform the city's 761 schools into "green islands" that will function as urban oases of cooler temperature. The first 30 Parisian schools were refurbished with green roofs, rainwater capture, cooling fountains and lots of trees. The strategy calls for all of Paris' schools to be transformed into oases by 2050. (The organization closed down July 31, but the Rockefeller Foundation has announced an $8 million commitment to support the work of chief resilience officers and member cities.) "All of these different parts of the infrastructure need to be designed to withstand extreme weather over the entire life span," Samaras says. U.S. infrastructure already desperate needs an update, even without accounting for the climate change threat. The country earned a D+ on the 2017 infrastructure report card issued by the American Society for Civil Engineers. The ASCE gave low grades to the nation's bridges, dams, levees, ports and inland waterways. The trouble is that all of those repairs and upgrades are expensive, and climate change is a notoriously politicized issue. (The Rockaway Beach restoration project cost $140 million.) Nevertheless, even a deeply partisan U.S. Congress proposed a $287 billion infrastructure bill in 2019 called America's Transportation Infrastructure Act that earmarked $4.9 billion over five years specifically for improving the resiliency of roads and bridges from extreme weather events. If passed, the bill would also create a $1 billion annual competition for resiliency projects in coastal states. * This story originally appeared in howstuffworks.com.

In reversal, Trump says climate change is not a hoax

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is backing off his claim that climate change is a hoax but says he doesn't know if it's man-made and suggests that the climate will "change back again." In an interview with CBS' "60 Minutes" that aired Sunday night, Trump said he doesn't want to put the United States at a disadvantage in responding to climate change. "I think something's happening. 
Something's changing and it'll change back again," he said. "I don't think it's a hoax. I think there's probably a difference. But I don't know that it's man-made. I will say this: I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs." Trump called climate change a hoax in November 2012 when he sent a tweet stating, "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." He later said he was joking about the Chinese connection, but in years since has continued to call global warming a hoax. "I'm not denying climate change," he said in the interview. "But it could very well go back. You know, we're talking about over a ... millions of years." As far as the climate "changing back," temperature records kept by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that the world hasn't had a cooler-than-average year since 1976 or a cooler-than-normal month since the end of 1985. The established scientific view is that the majority of warming is caused by humans. Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on ABC's "This Week" that a recent U.N. report warning of a looming climate crisis overestimated the risks. "I'm not denying any climate change issues," Kudlow said on the Sunday morning show. "I'm just saying, do we know precisely ... things like how much of it is man-made, how much of it is solar, how much of it is oceanic, how much of it is rain forest and other issues?" The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report found that policy changes must proceed at an unprecedented pace in the next 12 years to stop temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above Earth's preindustrial temperatures. The study found that "human activities" are estimated to have caused 1 degree C (1.8 F) of warming since the late 19th century, and it went on to note that "estimated (human-caused) global warming matches the level of observed warming to within (plus or minus) 20 percent." Also on ABC, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, called Kudlow's comments "so irresponsible, so dangerous." "We are in crisis mode, and you have an administration that virtually does not even recognize the reality of climate change, and their policies, working with the fossil fuel industry, are making a bad situation worse," Sanders said. * The Associated Press and Washington Post contributed to this report

Environmentalists putting pedal, mettle toward climate change

Environmentalists putting pedal, mettle toward climate change In 1979, as Environmental Protection Agency was beefing up the Clean Water and Clean Air acts, environmentally minded college student Mark Ailes, his friend Kay Richards and three other residents of their co-op at Michigan State University pedaled their bicycles from California to Michigan. "It was a trip of extremes," remembers Ailes, now 63 and living in Lombard. "It was hot. It was cold. 
We met some nice people, and we met some not-so-nice people." Forty-one years later, Ailes, who has been married to Richards for 37 years, is embarking on a bicycle trip to Washington, D.C., as part of a Citizens' Climate Lobby call to peddle legislative ideas to address climate change. Ailes will depart at 9:15 a.m. Saturday from the Starbucks across from Chicago's Millennium Park with fellow CCL of Naperville members David Gorman, 52, the assistant public works director for Lombard, and Mike Winter, 63, who lives in Wheaton and runs Sedwall precision tooling company in St. Charles. The trio will meet up with fellow bicyclist Michael Cushion in Michigan before completing their 12-day, 900-mile odyssey, receiving training and spending a day lobbying politicians. Ailes envisions the bike ride as a way to bring attention to the problem of climate change, which gets bogged down in politics and can be overwhelming. "It's a monumental problem," Ailes says. "It's hard to visualize what you can do and what effect it will have." A bipartisan, grass-roots approach to climate issues, the CCL currently promotes the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763). Ailes says the act would curb America's emissions by charging penalties to polluters, returning money in that Carbon Dividend Trust Fund to consumers, and encouraging new energy innovations. Ailes hopes to raise $5,000 in donations to the Climate Lobby Education effort through a link at donate.citizensclimateeducationcorp.org/fundraiser/2016878. Gorman, who lives in Downers Grove and also is Lombard's environment sustainability manager, says he certainly wants "to walk the talk." Winter, who rides his bike 17 miles to work most days, says he, Gorman and Ailes learned about CCL through a presentation at their DuPage Unitarian Universalist Church in Naperville. Instead of waging political battles, the CCL "has a way of making something everyone can get on board with," Winter says. Coming up with unique ways to tackle problems was part of the job for Ailes, a former physics teacher at Addison Trail High School who usually rode his bike to work. His teaching methods made him a finalist for Illinois Teacher of the Year in 1996. Showing how liquid nitrogen freezes objects quickly, Ailes not only used a frozen banana to hammer a nail into wood, he also pretended to freeze his finger by sneaking a hot dog inside his surgical glove and then smashed it to bits with a hammer. Richards, a former physical education teacher and swimming coach, has always been a bicyclist. She and Ailes are members of the Wheaton Pedal Pushers. But this trek will be a challenge, Ailes admits. With plans to stay mostly at campgrounds in sleeping bags under an uncomfortable-looking lean-to shelter that uses his bike as support, Ailes has mapped out the trip to average about 70 miles a day - and never pedal more than 97 miles in a day. This past November, Ailes lobbied local members of Congress and says even the "climate deniers" moved toward acknowledging a problem and wanting to help. After all, the climate affects everyone, from residents and vacationers on both coasts to farmers in the Midwest. "I have to think that we've got to try," Ailes says. "It's just a question of, 'Will we do enough, soon enough?'"

Trump rollback of mileage standards guts climate change push

WASHINGTON - The Trump administration's rollback of mileage standards Tuesday marks a win for Americans who like their SUVs and pickup trucks, but the government's own estimates show big costs, too - more Americans dying from air pollution, more climate-damaging tailpipe exhaust and more expense for drivers at the gas pumps. The administration's final rule relaxes future mileage standards for years to come, gutting tougher Obama-era standards that were the U.S. government's single most forceful initiative against climate-changing fossil fuel emissions. "Great news! American families will now be able to buy safer, more affordable, and environmentally friendly cars with our new SAFE VEHICLES RULE," President Donald Trump declared in a tweet. 
"Get rid of those old, unsafe clunkers. Build better and safer American cars and create American jobs. Buy American!" But Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups condemn the rollback, and years of legal battles are expected, including from California and other states opposed to the rollback. The rollback drew rare public criticism from former President Barack Obama, who largely has remained silent as his successor targets public health, environment and climate regulations from Obama's time as part of the current administration's regulation-cutting drive. "We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic. We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial," Obama tweeted after Trump's transportation and Environmental Protection Agency heads made the final rule public. Obama also ventured into this year's presidential campaign with the mileage rollback, telling Americans to ""vote this fall."" His vice president, Joe Biden, is the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Trump's new mileage standards will require automakers to achieve 1.5% annual increases in fuel efficiency. That's less than the more than 2% increases the U.S. auto industry is already averaging. John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing automakers, said the industry still wants middle ground between the two standards, and it supports year-over-year mileage increases. But he says the Obama-era standards are outdated because of the drastic shift to trucks and SUVs. Trump initially proposed simply dropping mandates for more fuel efficiency entirely, but he compromised after California and a dozen other states and a faction of automakers revolted, and after Trump federal officials had difficulty coming up with justifying arguments. The compromise "strikes the right regulatory balance that protects our environment, and sets reasonable targets for the auto industry," EPA chief Andrew Wheeler said. "This rule supports our economy, and the safety of American families." James Owens, acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said automakers still can sell electric powered and other more efficient vehicles. But he said the rule will ensure that more people can buy new vehicles. Almost the entire premise of the rollback is that car prices would drop an average of $1,000 because automakers would spend less on fuel-efficiency technology. "These are dollars that are coming out of consumers' pockets, out of families' pockets," Owens said. Industry analysts, however, say $1,000 won't mean much to the buyer of an average new vehicle, which cost just under $38,000 in March. Akmal Mujeeb, owner of Longhorn Sport Imports, a used-vehicle dealer near Austin, Texas, agreed Tuesday. "My honest answer is it's going to be marginal if anything," said Mujeeb, who sold new vehicles before starting his own business. "It's not going to make any difference in sales." The administration also argues that cheaper cars would prompt Americans to buy new vehicles with new safety technology, saving 3,300 lives on U.S. roadways through 2029. But experts dispute that claim, saying many of the vehicles traded in over the next eight years will be 4 and 5 years old, and there isn't much safety difference between those and new vehicles. David Friedman, vice president of advocacy for Consumer Reports, said the government also is assuming that because the vehicles' mileage won't be as good, people will drive less and be exposed to less risk on the road. He says that assumption is flawed. And opponents say dirtier air from the rollback will kill and injure more people than the rollback claims to save in roadway accidents. Drawing on the government's projections, the Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group projects 18,500 additional deaths from respiratory problems and other illnesses by mid-century, along with more illnesses and lost work days. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, resident Elizabeth Hauptman - a member of Moms Clean Air Force, a public health advocacy group - said the rollbacks would mean more soccer games cut short and fewer summer barbecues for her son, a 9-year-old with asthma. "He's going to miss more events," said Hauptman, who keeps the boy inside whenever air pollution readings are high, rather than risk another asthma attack away from home. "They look to you for help, and you just pray you get home in time to use your nebulizer." Opponents also project millions of tons more carbon dioxide and other climate damaging emissions, compared to the Obama mileage standards. The transportation sector, including autos, is the country's biggest source of fossil fuel emissions. Scientists in and out of the U.S. government during Trump's term have urged rapid cuts in fossil fuel emissions to stave off the worst of climate change. Trump frequently mocks the science behind climate change warnings, and he has ignored the warnings. "The only winner from this action is the oil industry, which wants us stuck driving dirty gas guzzlers as long as possible," said Gina McCarthy, Obama's former EPA chief, now head of the Natural Resources Defense Council advocacy group. Krisher reported from Detroit.

Argonne National Laboratory and AT&amp;T extend climate resiliency project nationwide

LEMONT - For over a year, the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory and AT&amp;T have been working together to project risks from a changing climate on America's southeastern region. Today they announced that they're extending their analysis to cover the entire contiguous U.S. In this ongoing collaboration, Argonne researchers are projecting the impacts of climate at regional, local and even neighborhood scales, using high-resolution models and a wide range of statistical methods for estimating uncertainty. AT&amp;T in turn is using these insights as input for its Climate Change Analysis Tool that enables the company to project how changes in climate will impact company infrastructure and operations up to 30 years into the future. 
When the projectfirst began, the collaborators were focused on modeling inland flooding caused by rainfall, coastal flooding from hurricanes, and wind events across four states: Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina. As their analysis expands to cover the contiguous U.S., researchers will add drought and wildfire risks. "AT&amp;T is building climate resilience because our customers, our employees and our communities depend on us," said Scott Mair, president of AT&amp;T Technology &amp; Operations. "By extending our work with Argonne National Laboratory to more states and including additional climate impacts, we can make more informed decisions, prepare our network for future extreme weather events and keep people connected when it matters most." By helping AT&amp;T - one of America's largest telecommunications, media and technology companies - understand climate change risks at a national level, Argonne is helping the company better ensure the resilience of its U.S. infrastructure. Hazards vary from coast to coast, region to region and even neighborhood to neighborhood, making it difficult for stakeholders in industry, agriculture and governments to understand how to adapt. Insights from the laboratory can help them make data-driven decisions to manage risk. As it did with the initial southeastern pilot, AT&amp;T will also make Argonne's data from this expansion available to the general public. "Comparisons are usually hard to do since people from different regions typically use different data and models. Having a national climate data set makes this a lot easier because everything will come from the same source," said Tom Wall, the program lead for Engineering and Applied Resilience at Argonne. "Sharing analyses and techniques across the country will hopefully lead to greater collaboration."

Join ranks of climate change 'believers'
I always thought that convincing a climate change denier of the error of his or her ways would be difficult. After all, such people seem rarely to understand science and the scientific method, and indeed often tout their ignorance as a matter of pride.
But a letter from Brand Bobosky (May 8) changed that impression. Mr. Bobosky says he will start being concerned about global warming when scientists can tell him how much of the warming is man-made and how much is due to natural causes. Well, I can help with that.
Mr. Bobosky should go online and access a report titled National Climate Assessment 2014. This is a report issued by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, and it has been reviewed by, among others, the National Academy of Sciences. There he will find a graphical representation showing the contribution to global warming of natural causes only, and natural plus man-made causes. He will see that the contribution to warming from natural causes is negligible. In fact natural causes have actually caused a slight decrease in average global temperature over the last 50 years or so. The report concludes that only man-made factors can explain the observed temperature increase.
That was easy. I am happy to welcome Mr. Bobosky to the ranks of those who consider global warming and associated climate change a major environmental concern.

Too soon to panic on new health care law
Why are the Democrats, social agencies and the media running around like Chicken Little screaming "the sky is falling" when mentioning the House proposed health care reform?
For the these organizations, the bill passed by the GOP in the House this is just one stage of any bill being passed by Congress. The Senate must present their idea of the health care reform which will take several months. The Senate is only raising concerns about a bill that has not passed and is only in the early stages of passage. The health care reform passed by the GOP is at least a quarter of the way before any type of reform.
Let's stop this panic attack that is being controlled by the Democratic leaders, social agencies that will not be effected for years and the media that is looking for something to write about.

Smoking-cancer link and climate denial
Thanks to Jim Fuller for the great report on the climate change panel at North Central College April 6. Weatherman Tom Skilling and Congressman Bill Foster were right to compare denial of the reality of global warming to the eerily similar denial of the link between tobacco smoke and lung cancer.
But the story doesn't end there. Many groups like the Heartland Institute who spread misinformation about climate change are the same ones that spent money in the past to confuse the public about smoking. In fact, as revealed in the recent film "Merchants of Doubt," these groups even involve many of the same individuals.
At first glance, the threat of a gradually warming globe might seem less intense than the pain and suffering of lung cancer. But while smoking only affects those who choose to smoke - and their immediate families - global warming will literally affect billions, now and especially in the future.
In some parts of the world, increasing extremes of drought, flood, heat waves and pathogens could drive millions into desperate migration. That's a recipe for massive worldwide conflict from which we cannot hide, particularly when our own infrastructure and public finances are under assault from sea level rise, wildfires and other damage.
Just like smoking, global warming exacerbates the risk of life-threatening harm from factors that have always existed, but have always been survivable - until now.
Please urge your elected officials to reject the demagoguery of the doubt merchants who lie and obfuscate about climate change. Our lawmakers will never come to grips with the immensity of this problem unless they hear our voices demanding it, loud and clear.

'Dump Care' is here
President Trump and the House Republicans passed their version of Trump Care but given all who will lose health care coverage it should be called Dump Care. Seniors, those with a disability, the poor, and individuals with pre-existing conditions are out, and massive tax breaks for those who do not need it benefit the most. One wonders who is left?
Historically, the Republicans have been for a few and forget about everyone else. They have been against Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the prescription drug benefit and now health care.
After their legislative victory was celebrated in the White House Rose Garden, Trump went to an event in New York where he noted that Australia had better health care than the U.S. He had no idea Australian had universal coverage through the government. Is it any wonder we are in the mess we are in?

Abortion funding bill should be vetoed
In the interest of full disclosure, Terry Cosgrove (letter supporting HB 40 appeared May 9) is the president of the Personal PAC, the Planned Parenthood political lobbying organization. He is paid to convince legislators and create public support for any legislation that is favorable to Planned Parenthood.
Securing funding for abortion through Medicaid as provided by HB 40 is a great triumph for him and his organization but is a detriment to Illinois. HB 40 denies the natural truth that all human life begins at conception and removes any mention of this fact from Illinois law.
Again, this is advantageous to Mr. Cosgrove and Planned Parenthood as it removes the human face from the act of killing unborn human children.
In spite of Mr. Cosgrove's passionate plea to Gov. Rauner to sign HB 40, our governor should stand firm in his commitment to veto this terrible law. While Mr. Cosgrove states that we pay for many things we don't like in a democracy, he neglects to remember that our republic was founded after a bloody revolution driven by laws to pay for things which our Founding Fathers thought unacceptable.
Many people in Illinois find the act of abortion - the killing of unborn human life - unacceptable. Equally unacceptable is a law that would force people to be implicated in the killing of unborn human life with their tax payments.
We all have a purpose in life. It's just not always clear at the very beginning what that purpose is. Snuffing out human potential is never good public policy. Veto HB 40, Gov. Rauner.

Local seniors talk climate change with "Grandfather of Climate Science"

Dr. Wallace "Wally" Broecker, also known as the "Grandfather of Climate Science," joined Windsor Park retirement community residents for a conversation and Q&A about climate change. The educational program was hosted by the Windsor Park Center for Lifelong Learning, which presents opportunities for continuing growth and enrichment through education and the creative and performing arts.
During the program, Broecker emphasized an urgent need to address the global challenge of climate change and called upon guests to be part of the solution.
According to the University of Michigan, just one person recycling their newspaper, magazines, plastic, glass, and metal for one year is enough to save 471 pounds of carbon dioxide from going into the atmosphere.
At Windsor Park, a resident-run GoGreen! team educates residents and works with the administration to institute policies and practices to reduce energy, conserve water, minimize pollution, and promote ecologically beneficial practices.

CARBONDALE - Justin Schoof, geography professor and director of Southern Illinois University Carbondale's School of Earth Systems and Sustainability, wants people to understand that climate change is real and impacting nearly every part of the world. "I think a lot of people aren't really aware of how solid the science is, or how we know that humans are responsible," said Schoof, who will deliver the University Honors Program Charles D. Tenney Distinguished Lecture on Feb. 20 at 6 p.m. "I'm going to talk about how we know." 
Schoof will present "Climate Change: Understanding the Role of Humans." The presentation is from 6 to 8 p.m. in Morris Library's John C. Guyon Auditorium. Admission is free and the event is open to the public. A reception featuring organic and local food will follow the lecture and a "Q&A" will follow the presentation. Schoof's appearance is part of the Charles D. Tenney Distinguished Lecture Series. Schoof has been at SIU since 2006 and received his Ph.D. from Indiana University in 2004. He recalls being very interested in the weather since childhood, when harsh winters in northern Indiana meant opportunities to make money shoveling snow. "I had to pay attention to the weather," Schoof said. Now, just about everyone has a view of climate change. "I really do try to steer away from the political aspects as much as I can, because I don't ever want to be viewed as being subjective," Schoof said. "I basically present people with best available data and try to explain in honest terms what the uncertainties are. I'm troubled by the rhetoric that suggests climate scientists don't want the problem solved because we benefit from it." Schoof intends to provide background on climate science, discussing everything from ice ages to more recent analyzation of ice cores drilled in Antarctica. The talk is for a general audience and Schoof will offer strong data to help better understand the role of humans in climate change. Schoof often gives lectures around the region, and he will dissect ongoing changes in Southern Illinois. He will discuss historical climate changes in the region, which are broadly consistent with global trends. SIU has a strong commitment to sustainability Jyotsna Kapur said the University Honors Program is "proud to be part of our campus' commitment to sustainability." SIU last fall earned for a seventh straight year a place in The Princeton Review's Guide to Green Colleges: 2019 Edition" and Silver STARS (Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System) ranking from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.

A role for business There are economic as well as personal interests in response to climate change

Global warming, besides being a human catastrophe, will damage the world's economies. It will elevate the costs of doing business - among other devastating impacts, it will result in great migrations of human populations and in making resources harder to find. In other words, there is every reason for businesses of all stripes to get proactive in developing climate change policies now. 
One hopes that the current political leadership in the U.S. will eventually see the error of rolling back environmental protections and dismissing climate change as a hoax, but business - like the rest of the planet - can't afford to wait for a hoped-for change of heart. Action is required now, and businesses are a big part of what must happen next - not only for humanitarian reasons but for pragmatic, economics-related ones. Successful businessmen and women are notoriously pragmatic. They have to be. CEOs have many things to concern themselves with, and whatever their personal feelings about climate change, they'll go where their customers and investors go. And increasingly, the public has been moving toward demanding action on climate change. A 2019 Pew Research Center study finds that compared with a decade ago, more Americans today say protecting the environment and dealing with global climate change should be top priorities for the U.S. The same study also indicates that millennial Republicans are more likely than their GOP elders to say the Earth is warming due to human activity. Moreover, many CEOs are seeing the benefits of proactively adapting their strategies to a likely future world: Witness Ford, Volkswagen, BMW and Honda striking a deal with California to steadily reduce the amount of pollution emitted by their new cars, despite President Trump's attempts to roll back the higher EPA standards set during the Obama years. Another thing business understands: A healthy, comfortable workforce leads to increased productivity. A peer-reviewed 2011 EPA study found that more than 13 million lost workdays were avoided in 2010 alone because of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. But the opposite is also true. A global 2018 University of Chicago study found that a 1-degree increase in the 10-day temperature average "increased the probability that a worker would be absent by as much as 5 percent." If our political leaders are unwilling to take us out of the wilderness on climate change, other leaders will have to fill the gap. American businesses, rather than be dragged unwillingly along, need to be among them. Indeed, in some cases they already are.

Inaction on climate change would cost billions, major EPA study finds

Inaction on climate change would cost billions, major EPA study finds
A global agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions would prevent nearly 70,000 premature American deaths annually by the end of the century while sparing the country hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of economic losses, according to a major government study on the cost of climate change.
Slowing the carbon buildup in the atmosphere would also prevent severe damage to a wide range of critical ecosystems, from Hawaiian coral reefs that support tourism to shellfish beds off the East Coast, said the report released by the White House on Monday.
The report, a five-year, peer-reviewed analysis that assesses the benefits of alternative strategies for dealing with climate change, concludes that every region of the country could be spared severe economic disruptions that would result if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to soar.
"The results are quite startling and very clear," said Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy, whose agency was the chief sponsor of the report. "Left unchecked, climate change affects our health, infrastructure and the outdoors we love. But more importantly the report shows that global action on climate change will save lives."
The report, "Climate Change in the United States: Benefits of Global Action," seeks to measure the potential gains for Americans under an international accord to keeps global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over historical averages. The study incorporates research from earlier peer-reviewed studies as well as modeling by scientists from the Energy Department's Laboratory complex and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other centers.
Researchers compared what would likely happen in a business-as-usual world, in which carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere soar to more than 800 parts per million by the year 2100, compared to levels of about 462 parts per million expected if aggressive action is taken over the coming decades to limit greenhouse-gas pollution.
The report concludes that the effort expended in combating climate change would yield a substantial dividend for Americans, with the benefits accumulating over time.
For example, improvements in air quality from reduced fossil-fuel emissions would lead to about 57,000 fewer premature deaths per year by 2011, the study said. Few extreme heat waves would result in 12,000 fewer deaths each year from heat-related illness, it said.
Local governments would avoid tens of billions of dollars in damage from floods and other severe-weather events, while farmers would save up to $11 billion a year in damage to crops from a combination of drought, flooding and destructive storms. Tens of millions of acres of forests would be preserved because of fewer wildfires, the report said.
"We not only have a moral obligation to act, but we also have an economic opportunity if we take smart but aggressive action to reduce gas emissions," said Brian Deese, a special adviser to President Barack Obama on environmental issues.
The report's authors acknowledged that they did not attempt to factor in all of the costs related to cutting greenhouses gases, or consider potential impacts overseas. Moreover, the study does not specify a strategy for keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius. Diplomats from 197 countries will meet in Paris in December to try to negotiate a treaty on reducing carbon emissions, but many climate experts say the pact will likely fall short of that goal.
But McCarthy pointed to the far greater costs of inaction, saying it was important start attacking the problem now.
"It is really not too late to avoid the worst impacts of climate change," she said.

The pope on climate change: 5 things to know
Chicago Daily Herald
January 20, 2015 Tuesday

NEW YORK - Pope Francis, who pledged on the day of his installation as pontiff to make the environment a priority, is drafting a highly anticipated encyclical on ecology and climate change.
Environmentalists are thrilled by the prospect of a rock-star pope putting his moral weight behind efforts to curb global warming. Francis said last week he wanted the document to be read before the next round of U.N. climate treaty talks at the end of the year.
But skeptics of global warming are irate that Francis is taking up the cause. Several of the critics have accused him of using Catholicism to cloak a radical environmental agenda.
Encyclicals are among the most important means for papal teaching and are written with the help of a small group of advisers under strict secrecy. Still, over the last year, Francis and his top aides have provided some clues about what the document could say.
Here are five things to know ahead of the document's release:
Papal precedent
Francis is extending the work of his predecessors. Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI both spoke of environmental protection as an urgent moral concern and placed the issue the context of church social teaching on helping the poor and promoting the common good.
In 1990, John Paul II said Catholics had a special religious obligation to protect God's creation from damage caused by "industrial waste, the burning of fossil fuels, unrestricted deforestation" and other practices. Benedict was dubbed "the Green Pope," for his frequent calls to stop ecological devastation and his efforts to bring solar power to the Vatican city-state. "Can we remain indifferent before the problems associated with such realities as climate change?" Benedict said in 2010.
Both pontiffs advocated for conservation as part of a "culture of life" that includes ending abortion. Francis has done the same in his remarks, decrying a "culture of waste" that devalues human life.
How far will he go?
Francis has already asserted that climate change is happening and people are partly to blame. "I don't know if it (human activity) is the only cause, but mostly, in great part, it is man who has slapped nature in the face," he said last week. He has also indicated the body of the encyclical will not be consumed with scientific analysis.
"It's not an easy issue because on the protection of creation and the study of human ecology, you can speak with sure certainty up to a certain point then come the scientific hypotheses some of which are rather sure, others aren't," Francis said in August. "In an encyclical like this that must be magisterial, it must only go forward on certainties, things that are sure."
At a U.N. Climate Change Summit in New York last September, the pope's top diplomat, Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, urged international intervention to curb global warming, "not only strengthening, deepening and consolidating the political process on a global level, but also intensifying our commitment to a profound cultural renewal," according to a Vatican radio transcript.
In a November speech in London, Argentine Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and a close friend of Francis, called for consideration of such policies as taxing and regulating environmental violations, among other moral and social remedies.
"Market forces alone, with no ethics and collective action, cannot solve the interrelated crises of poverty, exclusion and the environment," Sanchez Sorondo said. Still, Francis alone will decide what the encyclical will say.
Timing
On his trip to Sri Lanka and the Philippines last week, Francis said he had sent a third draft of the document for review by the Vatican orthodoxy guardian, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, along with the Vatican Secretary of State's office and his own theologian and had just received their replies.
The pope said he plans to "take a week" in March to review their suggestions and finish the encyclical, which will then be translated into several languages. The pope said he expects the document to be released in June or July.
Geography matters
So far, the loudest outcry against papal intervention on climate change is coming from political conservatives within the United States. Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, said the greatest resistance to taking action against climate change is centered in the U.S., Canada, Britain and Australia.
The strongest concern about global warming can be found in Latin America. The trend holds within the U.S., where Latinos are far more worried than whites about climate change, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.
Francis, a native of Argentina, is the first non-European pope in more than 1,000 years.
Beyond Catholic
Over the last two decades, every major religious group has made environmental protection a priority in one way or another. From using solar power for houses of worship to advocating for limits on greenhouse gases, religious leaders have framed the issue as a moral imperative driven by their faith's teachings. Among the most prominent has been Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians.
Francis said he read Bartholomew's writings as part his research on the encyclical. Sometime this year, Francis is expected to host a summit of world religious leaders to urge decisive action on protecting the environment.

A top investment strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management sent a note to clients this year with a dire forecast. Despite global efforts to stop climate change, sea levels are likely to rise dramatically, threatening the 40 percent of Americans who live along the coast. On the other hand, there will probably be some investment opportunities in sea walls. "A storm surge barrier system protecting New York City and parts of New Jersey could cost $2.7 million per meter," Michael Cembalest, the asset manager's chairman of market and investment strategy, wrote in his annual "Eye on the Market" energy newsletter in April. 
He added that governments would probably struggle to pay that cost, perhaps turning to either bonds or outright privatization. As the United States grapples with a second straight year of record hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, a small but growing number of hedge funds, pension plans and other investors are testing strategies to take advantage of those signs of climate change. Where they're putting their money provides a glimpse into some of the likely tangible impacts from higher temperatures. The investments include storm and flood protection along the coast, desalination plants in drought-prone regions, new approaches to agriculture and land far from the ocean for when rising seas shift the real estate market. "In the early stages, people will be nervous," says Cembalest, who calls himself an advocate for better flood control. "And the returns will be higher." There's a fatalism to investors' calculations. Global greenhouse gas emissions reached a historic peak last year, along with the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The last three years were the hottest on record. That trend is expected to accelerate: Scientists expect temperatures to rise by 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit from now to the end of the century. Yet an increase of as little as 1 F may have catastrophic consequences, according to a report issued Monday from scientists convened by the United Nations. They found that preventing global warming from passing that level will require a gargantuan and near-immediate shift in energy use. "There is no way at this point to stop climate change," says James Everett, partner and co-founder at Ecosystem Integrity Fund, a venture capital investor in San Francisco. "Pretty much every system is going to have to change. We're going to have to adapt to this." Investors focused on climate change have traditionally bet on fixes such as renewable power and electric vehicles. Mitigation and adaptation is a grimmer project. But Jay Koh, co-founder and managing director of the Lightsmith Group, a private equity firm focused on climate adaptation, says it's necessary to acknowledge that things could get worse. "There is a requirement for some kind of psychological journey that people have to go through," Koh says. "I'd rather have a strategy designed for the set of circumstances where we might not 100 percent win." Consider what might happen to food production. As precipitation patterns change and oceans become more acidic, outdoor environments will become less reliable and "more and more intolerant for crops or fish," according to Liqian Ma, managing director at Cambridge Associates in Boston. Demand will increase for technologies that allow indoor agriculture and even aquaculture. In other cases, making money off climate change can be as simple as thinking through the consequences of a hurricane. Last August, a week before Hurricane Harvey struck Texas, Rod Hinze had an idea. The principal and portfolio manager at Key Point Capital in Dallas, Hinze invests in real estate investment trusts, or REITs. As Harvey approached the coast, the cost of REITs that held hotels around Houston was falling, as investors assumed the hurricane would scare off tourists and business visitors, and maybe trash the hotels themselves. "People thought they'd be offline," Hinze says. "What they don't realize is the demand in short-term housing after a hurricane like that, it's astronomical." So Hinze bought low - first in Houston, and then, as Hurricane Irma followed a week later, in South Florida. "We saw occupancy go to 100 percent in a lot of those hotels," Hinze says. "We didn't crush it. But we made 25 percent, 30 percent, pretty quick." The broader public's failure to appreciate the risks of climate change - especially in the United States - is part of what makes it such a good area for investing, according to Barney Schauble, managing principal at Nephila Advisors LLC. "There is not a single other country where anybody smart isn't a believer in these things," he says. "If you can see something that other people just refuse to see, and you can make decisions on that basis, I suspect over the longer term that is going to put you in good stead." The fund managers and advisers interviewed for this story expressed little worry that the science is wrong. For some, a bigger concern was looking as if they were taking advantage of a slow-motion calamity. "I would love to give up these investment opportunities in a second if people would listen and stop polluting the environment," says David Vogel, founder and chief executive officer of the Florida-based quant fund Voloridge Investment Management LLC. In the meantime, he says, investors can be a societal warning system, alerting the public to a risk it has otherwise been reluctant to see. "If people are making money off it, that gets attention."

Demonstrators demand Roskam address climate change

More than 200 people rallied Monday in West Chicago to call on U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam to take action on climate change and support clean energy.
The demonstrators, some of them holding signs with slogans such as "Follow the science" and "Clean energy creates jobs," gathered in a large meeting room down the hall from Roskam's district office at the DuPage Airport before dropping off postcards for the congressman.
"We want to let him know that we think we need to do something about climate change," said Tim Milburn of the Sierra Club Northwest Cook County Group.
Milburn said local Sierra Club chapters organized Monday's rally because they're concerned that President Donald Trump's administration may reverse the progress that's been made on climate change mitigation and clean energy.
Organizers decided to reach out to Roskam because "he's not exactly a climate change proponent," Milburn said. He added that Roskam has "a bad record when it comes to dealing with this environmental issue."
J.C. Kibbey said during the rally that 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is real.
"Climate change is happening and it is caused by humans," said Kibbey, Midwest outreach and policy advocate for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "There is no continuing debate in the scientific community. And there is no question that the science is conclusive."
To fix the problem, "we need to move to a clean energy economy as soon as possible," he said.
Jack Darin, director of the Sierra Club's Illinois chapter, said everyone who attended the rally is "part of the majority" of residents in Roskam's 6th Congressional District "who want to keep moving forward." The district includes parts of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry counties.
"We want to listen to the scientists and act on climate change," Darin said. "Move beyond dirty fuels to clean energy for all the benefits that it offers to all the citizens of the 6th District, our country and our planet."
While there's a new president, Darin said, people in the 6th District didn't vote to stop creating jobs in solar and wind and energy conservation.
"They didn't vote to opt out of the global effort to stand up and solve climate change," he said.
Therefore, Roskam and other members of Congress should support efforts "to make sure the worst of President Trump's promises will never come true," Darin said.
Roskam wasn't at his district office Monday. According to a spokesman, he was in Washington D.C.
The spokesman issued a statement saying that Roskam supports an "all-of-the-above approach when it comes to energy."
"American ingenuity has made it possible to rid ourselves of our dependence on foreign oil and eliminate a major national security threat," the statement reads. "Each year, new advancements in technology and research allow us to better provide for our energy and security needs while safeguarding our natural resources for the future."

Foster, Skilling to lead forum at NCC on climate change

A suburban college that considers its Naperville campus a testing ground for renewable energy technology is hosting a forum on climate change at its new Science Center.
North Central College is hosting the free public event from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Saturday, May 6, in Ratio Hall on the second story of its $60 million Science Center, which opened March 27 at 131 S. Loomis St.
The forum will feature U.S. Rep. Bill Foster and WGN Chief Meteorologist Tom Skilling along with an environmentalist, a research meteorologist and a physics professor.
The policy implications of climate change can be debated, but North Central President Troy Hammond, a physicist before he was an administrator, says the issue is clearly one of the most pressing of this era.
Forum speaker Paul Bloom, an associate professor of physics at North Central, agrees.
"From my perspective, this is the scientific topic of our time," Bloom said. "So I think it's very timely, as part of the new Science Center that we've just opened on campus, to host a community conversation about this topic."
Foster's office organized the forum to discuss the local and global effects of climate change, which the Naperville Democrat says the "vast majority of scientists" believe is "real and man-made."
"The climate is changing - and is doing so very rapidly," Bloom said. "When you have so many uncorrelated, so many independent measures that are all telling you the same thing, then you really know that something is going on. And that's how science works."
Speakers including Mary Gade, president of Gade Environmental Group, an environmental consulting firm in Chicago, and Doug Sisterson, research meteorologist at Argonne National Laboratory, will approach the topic from a variety of perspectives.
"It's really an impressive array of expertise that's going to be available," Bloom said.
Doors open at 9 a.m. and the discussion begins at 9:30. Before and after the speakers, environmental organizations will have booths outside the hall to share additional information.
As host, Foster plans to focus the forum on what can be done to reverse the damaging effects of a warming planet.
North Central already has employed several measures to lessen the college's negative effects on the environment, Hammond says. The college has a large-scale solar panel system atop its Residence Hall/Recreation Center, a solar thermal system on a dorm, and a geothermal heating and cooling system in another major building, as well as high-efficiency LED lighting throughout campus and sustainable features in the new Science Center.
"North Central College is a real cutting-edge leader in terms of its implementation of renewable energy technology on our campus," Hammond said. "We're really excited about the statement the college is making in terms of existing in STEM education and our future in the sciences."
The college also is adding a new major in environmental studies in the fall, making now an even better time to host a wide-ranging, academic conversation about the environment.
"I hope it'll be a lively discussion," Bloom said.

Talk to right folks for facts on climate change

It makes me nervous when someone who might become president of the United States says the science on climate change is "convoluted" and that it is "arrogant" to assert that humans are the primary cause of global warming.
That's what happened recently when Jeb Bush, the still-undeclared presidential candidate, said the following at a campaign-style event in New Hampshire: "Look, first of all, the climate is changing. I don't think the science is clear what percentage is man-made and what percentage is natural. It's convoluted. And for the people to say the science is decided on, this is just really arrogant, to be honest with you. It's this intellectual arrogance that now you can't even have a conversation about it. The climate is changing, and we need to adapt to that reality."
I found his statement both reassuring and unsettling. It was comforting to see that Mr. Bush acknowledges the climate is changing. Reading between the lines on whether humans are to blame, however, the implication is that there's little or nothing we can or should do to mitigate the damage.
While it's true "we need to adapt to that reality," our ability to adapt will depend greatly on limiting the warming already under way. If we do nothing to curtail the heat-trapping gases we emit into the atmosphere, experts say we're looking at an average global temperature increasing by as much as 11 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. We cannot adapt to that.
Hence, my nervousness.
Mr. Bush isn't alone when it comes to not understanding that 97 percent of climate scientists are convinced, based upon the evidence, that human-caused global warming is happening. Opinion estimates from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication show that only 41 percent of Americans believe most scientists think global warming is happening. The Yale estimates show that 34 percent think there is a lot of disagreement among scientists and 25 percent simply don't know.
Why the gap between what scientists know and what the public thinks they know? Much of it stems from the he said/she said approach in the media that appears to give equal weight to the views of skeptics who do little or no actual research on the topic. These skeptics, many who write for think tanks that receive funding from fossil fuel sources, have succeeded in creating the illusion that a debate exists on the science of climate change.
It's a similar strategy employed by the tobacco industry years ago to question the addictive and cancer-causing properties of cigarettes. Go see the documentary "Merchants of Doubt" if you want to know more.
The bottom line is that I think Mr. Bush is getting bad information. That's why I want to make the following offer: Citizens' Climate Lobby will arrange, at our expense, to give him a private briefing with climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, who was named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People.
Trust me, there is not an intellectually arrogant bone in her body, as anyone she has ever spoken with will attest. She's also an evangelical Christian -- pretty uncommon in the scientific community -- who sees that faith and science are not incompatible. Any conversation with her is both enlightening and delightful.
Once we settle on the need to reduce carbon, I have someone else Mr. Bush should talk to: Former Secretary of State George Shultz. Secretary Shultz proposes that we solve climate change "the Reagan way," with a market-based approach that applies a rising fee on carbon, returning the revenue from that fee to all households.
Government doesn't keep (and spend) the money, and consumers are shielded from any economic fallout from pricing carbon. In fact, a study from Regional Economic Models Inc., finds that this proposal will reduce carbon emissions 50 percent in 20 years while adding 2.8 million jobs to the economy.
I suspect what's driving the "debate" about climate science is the fact that conservatives don't like the solutions, such as more EPA regulations. If you don't like the solutions, don't admit that there's a problem to be solved.
Fortunately for Mr. Bush, we have a solution conservatives should find easy to embrace. He just needs to talk to the right people.

The silenced: meet the climate whistleblowers muzzled by Trump

From weakening vehicle emissions to blocking warnings about how coastal parks could flood or the impact on the Arctic, the Trump administration is accused of muzzling climate science. Here, six whistleblowers and former government scientists describe being sidelined by the administration - and why they won't be quiet. Jeff Alson Role: A former senior engineer at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s vehicles lab in Ann Arbor, Michigan What did the work involve? "I was an engineer at the EPA, working for 40 years in a very technical job. In 2009, after the election of Barack Obama, the EPA started working on greenhouse gas standards for vehicles for the first time. 
It felt like we were making history. "There was a team of around 25 people producing thousands of pages of analysis for the standards. We knew it would be controversial but it was a very big deal, the first critical steps to address the climate crisis." What changed under the Trump administration? "Once Trump was elected it became pretty clear that things would change. The president came out to Michigan in March 2017 and gave a speech where he said he'd look at the standards, that they hurt economic activity and jobs. That was an obvious sign, really. "In August 2018 the administration proposed an eight-year freeze of the greenhouse gas standards. It was unbelievable, really - for the first time in the history of the EPA the political leadership decided to change pollution standards that were doing well without allowing the career staff and experts to play any sort of role. We were completely locked out. "There was no scientific or technical rationale to rolling back the standards, the analysis they used was the most biased thing I've ever seen. They cooked the books and changed every assumption they could to get the answer they wanted. It was so bad that some EPA career staff asked their bosses to take the EPA name off it all." How do you feel about your experience? "It broke my heart. I'd had this wonderful career, playing a small role in making the world a better place. Then we had a political leadership making decisions on ideology, denying science, basically being climate deniers. It felt horrible. "I was 62 years old and there were a few family things going on, but the Trump administration made a difficult decision to retire much easier. I felt I could do more good on the outside, educating the public on what's going on. By the time I left, the morale was the lowest I'd seen in 40 years. Our work had become irrelevant." Response from the EPA Asked by the Guardian on Monday about the concerns outlined by four former EPA scientists, the EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in a statement: "The EPA under President Trump has strived to create an agency that is responsive to the American people." The statement said this included "proposing the SAFE (Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient) rule that will save lives and produce savings for American consumers, working on the first major update to the lead and copper rule in nearly three decades". It added the agency was also "on track to become the first administration to complete an ozone NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) in the five-year review cycle envisioned by Congress", and had deleted 22 sites from the national priorities list of those eligible for Superfund cleanup, the most since the financial year 2005. Maria Caffrey Role: Worked on climate change at the National Park Service (NPS) What did the work involve? "I was studying how climate change will affect 118 coastal parks in the US for the National Park Service. I started this work in July 2013, it was my baby." What changed under the Trump administration? "My study went through peer review and was ready to be released but I was told by the NPS a few days after Donald Trump's inauguration that they were 'waiting for messaging' first. I thought that was no big deal but then nothing happened and I started calling up every few weeks to say, 'We've got to get this out, it's getting stale.' "The excuses varied but became ever more vague, such as 'we are ever so busy' or that it would worry people during hurricane season because it mentions storm surge in coastal areas. A superior said they wanted to keep a low profile on climate change for four or maybe eight years while Trump was around, which really upset me because we don't have four to eight years to do nothing. I felt I was being silenced. "I went on maternity leave around Christmas 2017 and the report still hadn't been released. I got an email from a colleague saying, 'Congrats on the baby, by the way you should know they are editing your report.' "We had a conference call and it became clear that any mention of human-caused climate change had been taken out. I was asked how I would feel if they didn't release the report at all, which felt like a threat. I stood my ground and was told 'they aren't going to be happy about this from above.' It was never clear who 'they' were - perhaps Trump himself or Ryan Zinke [the then secretary of the interior]. "I then had a meeting with a senior NPS official who came out from Washington DC. The other report co-authors were there, too. That's when it all unraveled, it became incredibly hostile. I was told not to attribute changes in public lands to human actions. "I felt like we worked for the American people and I didn't want to lie to them. But a superior said that we in fact work for the executive branch of which the president is the head. The president is the boss and we are going to put our heads down and put out the line of the administration. "A journalist did a freedom of information request and saw all the emails of us fighting over this and asked me for a statement. I ended up going on the record because I thought it was a very important issue. I was aghast I was being asked to lie. These people were violating the mission of the NPS. "After I came back from maternity leave I was demoted to be an intern on $25,000 a year. And then in February this year they said there was no money left at all and that I would have to leave. It was devastating. I offered to work for free as a volunteer but was turned down, which shows that it wasn't a money issue really. I packed up my office and I was gone. I filed a whistle-blower complaint in July." How do you feel about your experience? "I have faced retribution, I was threatened and placed in a hostile work environment. It's clear in some agencies there's a culture of fear where scientists are being intimidated. When I wrote this report, politics was the last thing on my mind, I was thinking about climate change and these coastal parks. "It's very frustrating, it's not where I pictured where my career would be at this time in my life. I don't even know if I have a career any more. What's left is in tatters." The National Park Service did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment. Chris Frey Role: A professor of environmental engineering at North Carolina State University, Frey was chairman of the EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and a member of the agency's Science Advisory Board. He left in 2018 What did the work involve? "The Clean Air Science Advisory Committee (Casac) is required to inform the EPA administrator over air quality standards, if they are sufficient to protect public health or not [under the Clean Air Act]. The EPA's Science Advisory Board is a much larger committee that takes on all sorts of things - clean water rules, vehicle greenhouse gas standards, rules about transparency and so on." What changed under the Trump administration? "Initially there was a neglectful relationship with the new Trump administration; they seemed uninterested and the amount of scientific advisory board work dropped off. Then, from October 2018, there were the first signs of the ideological assault on scientific advice at the EPA. "Scott Pruitt [then administrator of the EPA] wrote a memo that said that researchers that have received grants from the EPA aren't allowed to serve on panels because of a perceived conflict of interest. But there was no prohibition on industry people serving and the number of them on the panels has increased. It's been a way to kick qualified people off the boards and get cronies in their place. "There was a complete turnover of Casac and it shows in meetings. They now bumble through things because they don't understand the process and the Clean Air Act. Political appointees are interfering with the selection of candidates, essentially picking those sympathetic to the agenda of the administration, even if they have fringe views like climate change isn't happening, that kind of stuff. "I was on a panel looking at the risks posed by particulate matter. We had a lot more work to do but we were disbanded four days before the EPA released an assessment that we would've reviewed. The timing was mind-boggling. I found out by seeing a press release on the EPA website, which was followed by an email saying our services were no longer needed. "I was also a nominee for a panel on ozone but then they said they wouldn't go ahead with that. It was a little frustrating for me personally, but it's more of a loss to the American public. The EPA has always been thought of as a science-based agency; what we see now is no basic respect for science." How do you feel about your experience? "There's not even lip service to the science. Science can't be controlled like ideological spin, so the administration is afraid of that. They don't want scientists and their evidence-based opinions - they'd rather have cronies trot out the same tired talking points on fringe scientific views." Joel Clement Role: An expert on the impact of climate change on the Arctic at the Department of the Interior What did the work involve? "I was at [the department of the] interior for nearly seven years. I started on 3 January 2011 - I know the exact date because of how excited and inspired I was at the thought of serving in the federal government. I was hired as a senior executive to run the office of policy analysis, which sits in the office of the secretary. "One of the main areas of focus was addressing the impacts of climate change in the Arctic, which is warming two to three times faster than the rest of the planet. Entire Alaska native villages are threatened by rapid coastal erosion and storms because they no longer have a sea ice curtain to protect them from fierce Arctic storms in the fall and early winter, and the ground beneath their feet is falling away as the permafrost thaws." What changed under the Trump administration? "The new Trump team was very thin and most of them knew very little about the agency mission - they were mostly oil and gas lobbyists and some campaign workers. Whatever they were talking about up on the secretary's hallway, it sure wasn't being shared with the career staff at the agency. So you basically had 70,000 employees scratching their heads and getting back to doing their jobs while a couple dozen political appointees tried to get their act together to lead them. It was surreal. "But this neglect soon turned into scorn, characterized by comments from the new secretary, Ryan Zinke, that the staff were disloyal. Morale began to quickly plummet as the political ranks showed not only ignorance of, but disdain for the wide-ranging agency mission. Here you had tens of thousands of people working hard in public service and being told what they do is not important. "The National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service had it worst because they didn't have anything to do with oil and gas or mining permitting process, and the lobbyists in charge had no interest in wildlife, conservation or biodiversity. "But every agency suffered, because the mantra of the administration was to drain the swamp - and it quickly became clear that the swamp was not the high-paid lobbyists, but the rank-and-file government professionals who serve the country. "On a Thursday night in June, just a week after I'd been in New York to speak at the United Nations about climate change adaptation issues, I received an email that said I was being moved to a new position. "It was quickly obvious that this was a retaliatory action, as I was moved away from any climate change work to the office that collects royalty income from oil, gas and mining companies - an auditing position for which I had zero expertise. The email explained that because I had economists on my policy staff that I must clearly know about numbers, so I'd be good in an auditing office. "I'd heard that they were looking for a job that I would not want, in hopes that I would quit. It's not unusual for senior executives to be reassigned, it's part of the job, but reassignment can't be used to get people to quit - and Secretary Zinke testified to Congress a week later that he was using reassignments, among other methods, to trim the workforce. Sadly, I was only one of dozens of executives who were reassigned that night, many of us for clearly retaliatory reasons. "I found legal counsel and eventually filed a whistle-blower complaint and went public with an op-ed in The Washington Post. I wasn't worried too much about my job at that point, I was worried about the work I'd been doing on behalf of Alaska Natives, and it was clear they had no intention of continuing to work to help those frontline communities. "A couple months later I decided that they'd already taken my job, but there was no way I'd let them take my voice, so I resigned and continued to speak publicly about these abuses and the implications for American health and safety." How do you feel about your experience? "The Trump administration is threatened by evidence, by science and by expertise. These things interfere with their ability to hobble government agencies and reduce oversight. It's mind-boggling and a profound threat to democracy but it also increases risks to American health and safety. Every American should be concerned, regardless of political stripe." Response from the interior department A Department of the Interior spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian: "The department works to ensure that the scientific activities that it carries out use the best science and are the result of robust and independent processes." The department said it was required by law to research and publish reports regarding the changing conditions of the climate and has a "rich and long-standing culture of scientific integrity that prevails independently of individual administrations". Betsy Southerland Role: A long-term water quality official at the EPA What did the work involve? "I was at the EPA for 33 years, starting in 1984. I worked in the water program and on Superfund cleanups, working on the criteria for drinkable water." What changed under the Trump administration? "I left in August 2017 and made a very public retirement statement about how bad this administration is and its assault on science. It went viral and since then I spend 20 to 30 hours a week helping the press and Congress understand the impact of what the Trump administration is doing. "We've never seen anything like this complete abandonment of science, solely to maximize corporate profits. Everything changed after the election. The climate change section of the EPA website came down and Scott Pruitt came in and brought in a bunch of political appointees who didn't need Senate confirmation. "I was working on a chemical safety rule that was rewritten by Nancy Beck, someone from the American Chemistry Council [an industry lobby group] who Pruitt brought in. It basically repeated the talking points she used on the chemistry council. "Pruitt never spoke to any of the career staff before he made decisions on replacing rules. I worked on a rule that would require coal-fired power plants to treat toxic waste rather than simply dump it into leaky ponds. Pruitt met with Bob Murray [head of the coal mining firm Murray Energy Corporation] and decided to postpone the rule and the first we knew about it was when we were asked to check a draft press release about the rollback. "Scientists are really irrelevant at the EPA now, their input isn't requested. They are simply directed by the political team to help fulfill the desires of political donors, no matter the cost to Americans. At the moment it's just a logistical question of how fast they can go on this. They have something like 70 regulation repeals under way and because it will be hard to do this with legal challenges they want to undermine the underlying science." What happened after you left? "Within a couple of days of me leaving an opposition research firm did a freedom of information request for all my emails and the EPA immediately handed them over. I found out they made a big effort to connect with all the right-wing media to trash me. They made up this lie that I was being paid more than a Congress member for every year of my retirement. It got really ugly, so I got off social media. "The same opposition group then tried to find out if any EPA employees donated to [Bernie] Sanders or [Elizabeth] Warren. It's stunning to target federal employees like that. I've never seen that before." Jacob Carter Role: Worked on climate change impacts upon Superfund sites (toxic areas requiring federal cleanup) at the EPA What did the work involve? "I was brought in by the EPA to do climate change work for the office that oversees the Superfund site program, which are toxic areas that require a federal cleanup. "I was specifically working on the Superfund site program because President Obama had issued an executive order for any federal agencies that would put forward new federal dollars into infrastructure. Essentially, he wanted those agencies to incorporate climate change into flood risk for that infrastructure. "The model essentially looks at how much sea level rise is expected over the next 100 years. Plus what did the extreme floods look like in those areas? And I combine those two sets of data to create a model that is predictive of these future extreme floods that we're seeing more of currently and are expected to see more of in the future." What changed under the Trump administration? "I knew from President Trump, then candidate Trump's campaign, how he felt about climate change, that I was likely on the chopping block because I was a postdoctoral fellow and my contract was sort of on a year-to-year basis. "And so after the transition occurred, I was there for a couple of weeks and then one day my boss came to my office and said: 'I think you should probably start looking for another position.'" How do you feel about your experience? "It was a very difficult time for me, absolutely. I was extremely sad and depressed. I really liked the work that I was doing. I felt like I was doing research that was really going to have a significant impact. "I had worked really hard on it. To see something like that just get sort of tossed out the window was really disheartening to see. And the fact that they were just going to completely dismiss this climate change work altogether was also really disheartening. So, yeah. It was a very sad time for me. I will not lie. "There's a ton of different scenarios that have occurred that show that this administration really does not care about progressing climate change or climate science, in general. "I mean, any time you see some sort of report come out of the agency that even mildly mentions climate change and maybe its impacts to national parks, or something to that extent, the administration tries to downplay human connection to climate change. They try to downplay the role of climate change and federal scientists' work in press releases. "They try to downplay the role of climate change and research that they're funding. So even in grants that the agencies are receiving, they're now being vetted by political officials to essentially make sure that climate change is not mentioned in those proposals. It's not a great time to be a climate change scientist in the federal government." * This story originally ran on theguardian.com website.

Krishnamoorthi, challengers debate climate change responses

U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Schaumburg and his two challengers for the Democratic nomination for the 8th Congressional District seat compared their approaches to the issue of climate change and global warming Saturday. The topic was one of many he, Dr. Inam Hussain of Libertyville and William Olson of Schaumburg debated during an hourlong forum conducted by the League of Women Voters of the Palatine Area at the Schaumburg Township District Library in Schaumburg. 
A video of the entire forum will be posted soon at the League chapter's website at lwvpalatinearea.org. An audience member asked particularly whether the candidates would favor a government-imposed fee or "cap-and-trade" system to encourage businesses to reduce their carbon emissions. The latter approach sets a cap on companies' emissions but allows one to buy a higher limit from another's share. Krishnamoorthi said the topic is one of the most important of current times and that he is a co-sponsor of a U.S. House bill that would return the nation to the Paris Climate Change Accords. "This is vital in controlling carbon emissions," Krishnamoorthi added. "In my prior life as a small business person, we did important research in solar technology. And this is also vital - the expansion of clean, renewable energy to combat climate change." He said he cofounded the bipartisan solar caucus in Congress and that he was open to looking at either carbon fees or cap-and-trade as an additional effort to combating climate change. Olson had a somewhat different outlook. "There is in our discourse an hysteria about climate, which Mr. Krishnamoorthi repeats, where greenhouse emissions meet end-of-days mythmaking," Olson said. "I find the arguments uncompelling, that a rising average temperature will comprise a loop of feedback whereby the rate of warming will increase without return and cause a relatively rapid incineration of our planet." But Olson also characterized pollution of all kinds as "a scourge to human habitation" and said he'd written a bill that would financially reward investments in renewable energies and environmental remediation as described in the Green New Deal resolutions that he would support. Hussain recognized less nuance on the subject. "First of all we have to recognize that climate change and global warming is a real thing," he said. "It is the state of crisis we are ignoring, and the carbon emission with fossil fuels - that has to be limited." Hussain said the U.S. was going in the right direction until 2016 and its subsequent withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. He, too, expressed support for the Green New Deal as a step toward reducing fossil fuel use and incorporating more renewable energy sources into the nation's infrastructure. No Republican candidates filed for the March 17 primary. The 8th District is roughly centered in Schaumburg and includes areas of northwest Cook, northeast DuPage and northeast Kane counties.

Frightened, baffled about climate change

Frightened, baffled about climate change I am baffled and frightened.

And yet, despite what appears to be very unusual weather striking across our nation, I have seldom heard those stations identifying the changed weather patterns with climate change.

Scared, baffled about climate change I am baffled and frightened. I hear on national and local news about the weather as it is reported on Chicago stations and national stations daily: EF3s, EF4s, dozens of tornadoes, flooding, continuing pictures of homes, schools, churches, and businesses ravished, millions in the paths of the severe weather, many deaths, hundreds injured and many hundreds homeless.

Ralph McFadden Elgin We can only guess at when life begins Abortions have been around for thousands of years. There are two types: Those performed by nature or God, if you prefer, and those performed by humans. No one questions the legitimacy of those performed by nature or God. And, those performed by humans were largely accepted as simply part of life in many cultures; and it is still this way today. In fact, the Catholic Church condoned the practice until around 1869. So, from about 1870 until 1973 different states in the USA enacted various laws regarding the subject. These laws ranged from one end of the spectrum to the other. In the restrictive states, poor women were often butchered in unsanitary conditions. Fortunately, in 1973 the Supreme Court (Roe vs. Wade) made these state laws void by establishing a uniform law across the entire USA. At the moment, abortions are legal and safe across the country, though, shamefully, access is becoming difficult for the poor. No one knows when the "precise" moment of death occurs and no one knows when the "precise" moment of life occurs. Therefore, all cultures are forced to simply make a decision about these matters. In fact, the answer may be unknowable. No one awakes in the morning excited about getting an abortion. No government agency is telling anyone to have or not have an abortion. I'm not for or against the practice, but it clearly belongs in the "freedom-to-choose." category. If you, your family or neighbor is faced with this difficult decision, follow your belief or heart but please don't impose your belief on others. Freedom is an American value. John S. Strauss Campton Hills Looking forward to new series Regarding the monthly "Pulling Back The Curtain" feature, congratulations on a great idea, which was on the Daily Herald's Opinion page. Your new series is not only informative, it is very interesting. As a former St. Johns University student, my favorite subject was and is English, reading and politics. I'm looking forward to your monthly series. Keep up the good work. Ellen Butler Huntley Consequences of gas tax hike I wonder if those politicians that voted for Pritzker's destructive gas tax increase ever considered the domino effect of their affirmative vote. If you think the only effect of his gas tax increase will be a couple more dollars that you will pay every time you fill your tank, here are a few things to consider: School bus companies include the cost of gas in the charges they make to schools for their services. Since schools in Illinois are financed by property taxes their increased cost will be financed through property tax increases. Consider the extra cost for taxi, Uber, limo and livery services. They are going to have to charge their customers more to cover the additional expense. How about the increased cost to farmers, who use gas to operate their equipment? Up goes the price of the food they grow. When you think about it, every business that depends upon automotive transportation in one form or another will suffer the increased gas cost. What does a business do to cover increased costs, they raise the price of their good or service or, in some cases move or go out of business. Pritzker's gas price hike is going to do tremendous damage to our state's economy. Let's hope that Illinois voters will remember the names of those politicians who voted in favor of Pritzker's massive gas tax increase including the "RINO" Republicans when they come up for re-election. Maybe we can turn their affirmative gas tax increase vote into a self-inflicted term limit. Who do you think will suffer most from this tax increase? You guessed it, the low and middle class Illinois citizens, the people Pritzker promised to protect. Again, remember what happened when it comes time to vote again. Norm Janowicz Spring Grove Pay more attention to tax policies We most often contemplate tax policy alternatives as either "progressive" or "fixed rate." We need to pay more attention to the "regressive" nature of tax policy we commonly call property tax. This tax disproportionately affects lower income homeowners (and renters as well). For homes of equal value, the property tax is generally the same, even though household incomes can be widely different, making the effective tax rates against income widely different. For example, a household with $60,000 annual income will pay at five times the tax rate against income that a household would pay with $300,000 income. Sadly, when tax levels defeat a homeowner's ability to pay, the state or county can assume control of the home. It is like not paying a mortgage. Owners are moved out and family belongings left behind are moved to the curb for trash pickup. I assume this is a rare instance, but it is rare only because anybody who understands the policy is going to do everything to avoid it. The other side of this issue is the reason for the tax. Close to 75% of our property tax is for school system operating costs. I believe the costs are exorbitantly high - a fact of life imposed by educators, their unions and self-serving politicians. The whole thing looks like a cabal, a socialist society, draining the county and state of resources. It is a system independent of free market principles that seem desperately needed.

It's incomprehensible to deny climate change The oddest thing about climate change is not the fact of it, but the dialogue about it. Look, the climate is changing, the data is clear. The world is warming. 
Why is this a political discussion? Why does one party line up to deny man-made climate change? Good news: At least Florida's politicians are finally getting it. Maybe because it affects that state directly. A scientist can point to charts and tables, but that's when the deniers' eyes glaze over. Let me just add one recent datum: Greenland's ice is melting faster than expected and could add 26 inches to sea level by 2100. Source: ScienceFocus.com, BBC and others. Climate change is not a hoax, as some who are politically motivated maintain. Did you ever see a greenhouse on a cold snowy day? The green plants inside are doing just fine. Greenhouse gases work the same way that greenhouse glass works. It's not a political question. You can't lobby Mother Nature. Here are the arguments: "The climate is always changing." Well, yes. Just like there have always been car accidents and for lots of different reasons; does that mean we should barrel through red lights? "The predictions are wrong." Yes, many have been off somewhat. But, so have many of Newton's (you know, the apple and the tree guy) gravity predictions until modified slightly by Einstein. An apple will still fall from a tree despite errors in Newton's law. Even though Newton was wrong, no one is encouraged to walk off a roof. Let's say nine of out 10 doctors tell you that a life threatening tumor you have must be removed as soon as possible. Let's say one out of 10 says, "Nah ... let's wait to see what happens." Which doc's advice would you follow? Sanford Morganstein West Dundee

The wrong position on climate change I attended the recent Republican Forum in Naperville held by the League of Women Voters. Jeanne Ives gave a shocking response when asked about climate change. She stated that the earth's climate has always changed, the Paris Climate Accord was a disaster, no one should be expected to give up fossil fuels, and that CO2 was not a pollutant. 
Encyclopaedia Britannica defines pollution as "the addition of any substance to the environment at a rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, recycled or stored in some harmless form." The EPA stated that CO2 was a pollutant in 2009 so controls on CO2 emissions could be started. We are already experiencing early climate change effects, including increasing wildfires, more violent weather, early sea level rise, and drought. It is vital to address CO2 emissions now. Jeanne Ives dismisses any concerns about climate change. All scientific evidence shows it dangerous to our planet. Action is needed now. Congressman Sean Casten has been a green energy entrepreneur and has sponsored bills to promote clean energy. He needs our support. Vote for our planet. Vote for Sean Casten in the March 17 primary. Carolyn Oesterle Glen Ellyn Candidate to believe in While attending a few political functions I had the good fortune of meeting one candidate named Jeanette Ward. I was extremely impressed with her compassion and her determination to be elected to represent the Republican Party for the senate seat of the 25Th district. I found her to be very approachable and will gladly answer any questions I had without hesitation. She even brings her daughters to these political functions as a teaching method for them to get a better idea how the system works and why it's important to be informed. Jeanette and her husband have lived in the Chicago area for the past 22 years and she holds two master's degrees and a bachelor of science. She is a person of integrity and simply wants to get elected to make a difference. She will work very hard for the people she will represent I truly believe she is a fantastic candidate. So much that I donated to her campaign, and I don't even live in that district. I just believe in Jeanette Ward. Ray Eaton Pingree Grove

Global warming stats not revealed
Paul Anderson's letter regarding the lack of proof of climate change is spot on. When I was a student at Saint Joe's in Downers Grove many years ago the good nuns talked at length about the last Ice Age and how we were nearing its end in another 200 to 300 years.
Yet these "scientists" never seem to attribute any of the alleged global warming to mother nature. In fact, they never give a percentage of global warming that they claim is caused by CO2.
Finally, he asserts that "some people believe they can affect the climate." These people seem to be from the Western world. How are they ever going to convince China, India and other developing countries that they are doing just that, much less ask them to pay to correct it?

'Natural' causes not to blame for climate change
One of the arguments used by people who fear the implications of human choices as the cause of climate change - including in recent letters printed by this paper - is that carbon dioxide is natural and essential to life on this planet. As with every instance of cherry-picked data, such statements are true only under very limited conditions.
The natural earth, whether a product of Creation, evolution or some combination of the two, is full of chemicals that are natural and essential "e.g., water, cobalt (in vitamin B12), sodium chloride (table salt), hormones, sugars, fats, copper, etc. Yet each is beneficial only within a specific range of quantity or proportion (i.e., dose) over a certain time (rate) and exposure route.
Some effects even vary with phase and temperature. Water inhaled as a vapor at normal temperatures, for instance, is essential to our well-being, whereas inhaling water as hot steam or as liquid could be fatal.
Further, what is beneficial to one life-form may be lethal to another. Indeed, the effects of many chemicals vary with the stage of development when exposed.
Life on this planet exists only in balance with other chemical and geological processes that have their own sensitivities to different chemicals, including carbon dioxide.
Finally, there is absolutely nothing "natural" about the carbon dioxide waste produced by burning fossil fuels that had been buried deep within the earth and that require ever-more extreme methods for their access and extraction.
There is nothing "natural" about the billions of tons of extra carbon dioxide dumped each year into the very thin layer of the atmosphere that is intimately connected to the chemistry and geology upon which life as we know it depends.
The natural substance argument provides no refuge to those avoiding the reality of human causation of climate change!

Let's not repeat mistakes of the past
As expected given the recent spate of news coverage of the Paris climate talks, deniers have stepped up their letter writing, trotting out the same old arguments about why it isn't real. They seem to have missed the fact that for more and more Americans, this false debate is over.
A majority of the public now agree that climate change is real and should be addressed.
And, of course, despite the deniers' claims to the contrary, almost all qualified climate scientists are in complete agreement about the reality of climate change, its direct link to excess atmospheric CO2 produced by the burning of fossil fuels and the real risks this poses for society.
But possibly the most telling sign that the argument is over is the fact that a number of major oil producers (Exxon, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total SA and Statoil) are admitting that this is the case and are calling for a tax on carbon as the best way to begin to address this problem.
I doubt that their scientists are trying to scam their bosses.
We should make no mistake. There will be a transition away from fossil fuels in the near future. What we have to ask ourselves right now is, to paraphrase retired Rear Admiral and climate scientist David Titley, do we want to continue to live in denial, watching Europe, India and China develop and market the many new products and services needed for this transition, or do we want to provide these things from Silicon Valley, Seattle, Houston, Chicago, Boston, New York and a myriad of other American cities and towns.
I am sure many cart and buggy manufacturers were firmly convinced that the automobile was just a passing fancy. That didn't work out so well for them. Let's not repeat the mistake.

The pandemic's lesson on climate change As Gov. Pritzker announced our move to Phase 3 reopenings, I allowed myself a moment of hope for all who are suffering in this COVID-19 economy. 
As the governor praised Illinoisans for cooperating with state restrictions in order to get us to this point, I realized that we will need to cooperate like that again to fight climate change. Though it will be a long, hard fight to overcome the coronavirus, our economy will eventually rebound ... but the outlook for our climate is different. We only have about 11 years before we see permanent changes we literally will not be able to live with. The human body cannot sustain normal outdoor activities at a heat index above 132 degrees (temperature plus humidity) and the journal Science Advances has just found that places in Pakistan, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have already surpassed that maximum at times. Even cities on our own Gulf Coast, like New Orleans and Biloxi, are sometimes seeing heat index extremes of 125 degrees. Once we start seeing more places where the temperature is too hot for humans to live, we will see mass migrations and competition for resources and livable land. That could lead to a tragedy that can't be alleviated by a lockdown or potential vaccine. We did not expect the speed or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope we will listen to science and cooperate again so we are not similarly blindsided by climate change. Karen Campbell

A deeper look at pope's climate change statement

Reducing Pope Francis' encyclical "Laudato Si" to a white paper on global warming is, in George Weigel's fitting analogy, "akin to reading 'Moby Dick' as if it were a treatise on the 19th-century New England whaling industry." The whole spirit and story of the thing is missed.
The pope's sprawling, ambitious statement - setting out a theory of nature and of the human person - will be profitably scrutinized for decades. Environmentalists who like some of Francis' conclusions will find, if they sit quietly with the text rather than rummaging through it for the politically relevant bits, that the pope is making a frontal assault on a technological and utilitarian worldview that treats creation as "raw material to be hammered into useful shape," reduces humans to mere consumers and treats inconvenient people as so much refuse.
In the pope's vision, both nature and human nature are gifts to be appreciated and accepted, not despoiled or redefined. And the ultimate demonstration of God's attitude toward nature is the incarnation, in which the creator - so the remarkable story goes - somehow became a crawling, puking, sleeping, living, dying creature, occupying a biological niche, in a thin layer of air, on a floating, fragile ball.
Francis is offended - infuriated, really - by how humans have treated their home and one another. And he has particularly harsh words for habits of consumption and exploitation in rich countries. The pope is frankly distrustful of global capitalism and the "logic of markets." It is fair to say that Francis has a broader understanding of the (very real) flaws of the developed world than he has of the economic conditions that might allow large numbers of poor people to join the developed world. But an uncomfortable relationship with modernity - including classical liberal economics - is hardly new in Catholic social thought.
The pope's environmental concerns are broad (clean drinking water and biodiversity rank high). But there is no getting around the fact that Francis regards potentially catastrophic, human-caused global warming as a fact. "A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climate system. ... A number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases ... released mainly as a result of human activity."
In American politics, the pope's encyclical has not made legislative action on climate change inevitable; but it has made the issue unavoidable. The politician's shrug, "I'm no scientist," is no longer acceptable. If climate change is a global threat, addressing it, as the pope argues, is both a moral and public requirement.
But the dysfunctional American debate on climate change illustrates a broader challenge. Ten or 15 years ago, this issue was less divisive. But it got pulled into the polarization vortex. And now the two sides do not merely hold different policy views, they have different versions of reality. The camps not only advocate different solutions; they inhabit different factual universes.
Many conservative Republicans now deny the existence or danger of human-caused warming and routinely question the motives of scientists who speak up on the issue. For a conservative to stray from skepticism is regarded as ideological betrayal.
In a recent National Affairs essay, Jim Manzi and Peter Wehner provide an explanation: "The Republican position - either avowed ignorance or conspiracy theorizing - is ultimately unsustainable, but some still cling to it because they believe that accepting the premise that some climate change is occurring as a result of human action means accepting the conclusions of the most rabid left-wing climate activists. They fear, at least implicitly, that the politics of climate change is just a twisted road with a known destination ... ceding yet another key economic sector to government control."
This is the temptation of the ideologically intense on left and right: Truth exists to serve the narrative rather than the narrative arising from truth. It is a malady easy to see in others and harder to diagnose in ourselves. But it is dangerous to democracy. Without a common factual basis, it is impossible to make incremental progress on public matters. All that remains are shouting matches and power plays.
The pope's views on climate change are shared by every national academy of science in the world, including our own. But, as Manzi and Wehner demonstrate in their essay, there are distinctly conservative responses to global warming, particularly in promoting energy innovation.
Conservatives can choose their policy reaction, but not their own reality.

Callers decry EPA chief's climate change stand

WASHINGTON - Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt's phones have been ringing off the hook since he questioned the link between human activity and climate change.
The calls to Pruitt's main line, 202-564-4700, reached such a high volume by Friday that agency officials created an impromptu call center, according to three agency employees.
By Saturday morning calls went straight to voice mail, which was full and did not accept messages. At least two calls received the message that the line was disconnected, but that appeared to be in error.
Before the number was disabled, interns were dispatched to answer some of the incoming calls, according to one employee. At times, calls to that number ended up going to voicemail.
While constituents sometimes call lawmakers in large numbers to express outrage over contentious policy issues, it is unusual for Americans to target a Cabinet official.
Pruitt's comments on the CNBC program "Squawk Box" - that "we need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis" over climate change - prompted an immediate pushback from many scientists and environment groups. It also drew a rebuke from at least two of his predecessors at the EPA.
"I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see," Pruitt said on CNBC.
The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that it is "extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century" - a position reiterated on EPA's own website.
On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose at a record pace for the second straight year, reaching 401.5 parts per million. The two-year surge in carbon concentrations that took place in 2015 and 2016 has no precedent in the 59 years in which the agency has been tracking the CO2 levels.
level of CO2 in the atmosphere.
Despite the quick and fierce backlash to Pruitt's comments, which put him at odds with his own agency and most governments around the globe, not everyone was so quick to criticize his views.
"If I am interpreting Pruitt's statements correctly, I do not find anything to disagree with in what he said: we don't know how much of recent warming can be attributed to humans," recently retired Georgia Tech climate scientist Judith Curry, who herself has questioned the extent of the role humans play in global warming, wrote on her blog. "In my opinion, this is correct and is a healthy position for both the science and policy debates."
There is no immediate evidence that any environmental organizations organized the deluge of calls to the new EPA administrator, but a single comment on Reddit may have helped spur the outpouring of criticism. The post outlined how Pruitt's opponents could contact his office, writing:
"Here's the number to call his office (EPA Office of the Administrator) to offer your feelings about Pruitt's comments: (202) 564-4700. Script: Hi, my name is _________. I'm calling because I'm seriously concerned about Scott Pruitt's claim that CO2 is not a major driver of climate change. The role of CO2 and humans as drivers of climate change is widely accepted among the scientific community, and I'm deeply concerned that Mr. Pruitt, as the head of the EPA, rejects scientific evidence."
In December, the League of Conservation Voters launched a petition drive on climate change aimed at President Donald Trump and his children. David Willett, its senior vice president for communications, said Friday that the league had not organized any sort of phone-call campaign related to Pruitt's comments but had seen an uptick in support in the past day and a half. The organization launched an appeal Thursday focused on threats to EPA funding and had its second-biggest online fundraising day ever, Willett said, but he declined to disclose how much money was raised.
"It's not surprising to hear people are calling after Pruitt contradicted his own agency's science," Willett said. "We're seeing record-setting response rates to mobile alerts, petitions and funding appeals."

Yes, you can make a difference on climate change

Fifth in a series We tend to think of climate change as a monumental global challenge that can be reduced only by the concerted efforts of nations, and certainly, a commitment by governments and international corporations is essential to the planet's response. But each of us as individuals can have an impact too, not just because of the effects of our personal efforts, but also because our positive or negative behavior influences those around us more than we may realize. "In a world of more than seven billion people, each of us is a drop in the bucket," Canadian geneticist and environmentalist David Suzuki says, "but with enough drops, we can fill any bucket." What can any of us do? Our first recommendation is to complete a carbon footprint calculator to determine how much carbon your family is contributing to the environment so you can determine some simple and for the most part inexpensive ways to reduce it. Several of these calculators are available on the internet and almost all of them are credible and useful. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has one at www.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator. If you don't use a computer, request information from: Climate Change Division, Office of Atmospheric Programs (MC-6202A), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20460. You also can find several articles on the internet with suggestions of what an individual can do to combat climate change. 
Some are more doctrinaire than others, but if you take the time to go through some of these articles, you can decide for yourself what sounds practical and doable for you. Among those to consider, a 2017 article "How You Can Stop Global Warming" with 101 suggestions from the environmentalist Natural Resources Defense Council; a 2018 article "Top 10 Things You Can Do About Climate Change" from the environmentalist David Suzuki Foundation; and a 2017 Forbes article, "9 Things You Can Do About Climate Change;", What can any of us do? Above all, become informed, and then casually talk about it with friends, neighbors, colleagues and family - not just about your concerns but more importantly, about what you're doing personally. This may be the most important thing you can do. You don't need to lecture or to be preachy; in fact, that approach may in some circumstances be counterproductive. You just need to drop the topic into conversations. Approach this as a topic the way a good parent approaches conversations with his or her kids about drugs: A specific sit-down occasionally perhaps, but mostly, the little references you make as part of everyday conversation that reinforces how you incorporate this challenge into your lifestyle. A few basics: Transportation is a big contributor to greenhouse gases. Drive less, fly less, if you can. When you buy a car, make high-mileage a priority, consider hybrids or electric-powered vehicles. Avoid running your car in idle. Don't run the air conditioning unnecessarily. Minimize purchases that require international shipping; in part, that means buying fruits and vegetables in season when they're more apt to be available domestically. It's no joke that livestock contributes significantly to greenhouse gases. You don't necessarily have to become a vegan, but even a reduction in the amount of meat and dairy you include in your diet can have a big impact. Gradual moderation is a practical approach and one that makes a difference. At home, put on a sweater in the winter, wear a T-shirt in the summer, aim to run the furnace and air conditioner less. Turn off the unnecessary lights and use energy-efficient light bulbs. Take an inventory of all the devices that are plugged in all over the house, and unplug whatever ones you can. Look for the blue Energy Star label when buying appliances, furnaces and air conditioners. Power your home with renewable energy sources. Remind yourself that as one person, you don't need to solve the world's climate problem. You just need to make a difference. And you can.

Get ready to hear about global warming - or the "climate emergency" as the United Nations is calling it. In the next week, there will be climate strikes, climate summits, climate debates, a dire climate science report, climate pledges by countries and businesses, promises of climate financial help and more between now and Friday. * In one of the largest youth-led demonstrations in history, millions of people from Manhattan to Mumbai took to the streets around the globe on Friday, their chants, speeches and homemade signs delivering the same stern message to world leaders: Do more to combat climate change. 
And do it faster. From small island nations such as Kiribati to war-torn countries such as Afghanistan, from small towns in Africa to major European capitals, and across the United States, young people left behind their classrooms to collectively demand that governments act with more urgency to wean the world off fossil fuels and rapidly cut carbon dioxide emissions. * In the U.S., organizers said more than 1,100 strikes took place across all 50 states on Friday. * On Monday, leaders from across the world gather at the climate summit in New York. The U.N. chief wants the world's carbon pollution to be cut by 45% in the next decade. * On Wednesday, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will issue a special science report on climate change's effects on the oceans and the world's ice and the outlook for seas to rise higher than previously thought. * German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition agreed on a landmark package Friday totaling about $60 billion by setting a price on carbon-dioxide emissions for transport and providing incentives for cleaner technologies. Her goal is to get Germany's climate policies back on track, easing mounting pressure at home and giving her something to showcase at a UN conference next week.

Kudzu that ate south heads north as climate changes

As the climate warms, the vine that ate the U.S. South is starting to gnaw at parts of the North, too.
Kudzu, a three-leafed weed first planted in the U.S. more than 100 years ago for the beauty of its purple blossoms, has been spotted in every county in Georgia, Alabama and North Carolina. It chokes young trees, brings down power lines and infests abandoned homes. Now the plant, which can grow as fast as a foot per day, is creeping northward, wrapping itself around smokestacks in Ohio, overwhelming Illinois backyards and even jumping Lake Erie to establish a beachhead in Ontario, Canada.
The invasive plant costs U.S. property owners about $50 million per year in eradication, according to the Nature Conservancy. Other estimates are 10 times higher. Agronomists and landscapers fear what the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Lewis Ziska calls the star of "a bad 1950s science-fiction plant movie" will continue to expand its role, making a nuisance and carrying a disease devastating to soybeans. Climate change is partly to blame, Ziska said, with the average U.S. temperature rising as much as 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895, most of that since 1970, according to the National Climate Assessment issued by the White House in May.
"The one thing that's kept these invasives in check has always been cold weather," said Ziska, a plant physiologist at the USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Beltsville, Maryland. "As the winters warm as a result of a changing climate, that more or less opens up a Pandora's box of where these invasives can show up in the future."
Invasive Species
Invasive species of all types cause an estimated $1.4 trillion in damage worldwide each year, $138 billion of that in the U.S., according to the Nature Conservancy.
Gypsy moths brought from France spread throughout the U.S. and took just three years to strip the leaves off hardwood trees in an area the size of Virginia, according to the U.S. Forest Service. More than 5 million feral swine, descendants of pigs brought to the New World by Spanish explorers, roam forests in at least 35 states, feasting on corn crops and uprooting fences. The Asian citrus psyllid, a gnat-sized insect, has spread a disease killing oranges in Florida, shrinking this year's crop.
Kudzu was introduced in the U.S. at the Japanese pavilion during the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, according to John Peter Thompson, who represents the Maryland Nursery and Landscape Association on the U.S. government's Invasive Species Advisory Committee. For decades afterward, landscapers touted its potential as a forage crop and popularized it in the South to prevent soil erosion.
Then it got out of hand.
"By the 1970s, it was the vine eating the South," Thompson said. "Kudzu becomes the poster child for alien invasive species gone wild."
Kudzu thrives along roadsides and open areas, and there's no "silver bullet" to get rid of it, with most people relying on a combination of pesticides and digging up the root crowns, said Nancy Loewenstein, a research fellow at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. Its ubiquity in the South landed it on the cover of R.E.M.'s 1983 album, "Murmur."
Kudzu's roots are starchy enough to make them a potential biofuel source, similar to corn, according to a paper by researchers led by Rowan Sage of the University of Toronto. Doug Mizell, a 61-year-old self-described tinkerer in Cleveland, Tennessee, said he successfully concocted fuel from kudzu in his garage laboratory in 2007.
Replace Feedstocks
"What we were interested in was replacing feedstocks that were food-based with something with no present intrinsic value, something that actually was the bane of the existence of people in the South," Mizell said in an interview.
His company, Agro-Gas Industries LLC, tried without success to attract the $5 million from government and private sources Mizell said would enable him to make about 6 million gallons of "kudzunol" a year, he said.
"Maybe our time is yet to come," Mizell said.
For now, a weed is a weed is a weed.
"I don't even know another plant like this," said Randy Westbrooks, an invasive species prevention specialist at Invasive Plant Control Inc. in Whiteville, North Carolina. "If you see it on your property, get rid of it as soon as you see it."
In Canada, kudzu has been found in a 0.5-hectare (1.23- acre) spot on the shores of Lake Erie near Leamington, Ontario, said Michael Irvine, the province's vegetative management specialist with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. It's "pure speculation" how it got there, he said.
Soybean Rust
The plant is a host for soybean rust, a disease that can be a "serious problem" for farmers, said Thompson of the invasive species council. Last year, soybean rust showed up in 408 counties in 13 states, according to the USDA.
Jerry King said he battled kudzu for 10 years in the backyard of his Thebes, Illinois, home in the 1990s and 2000s. Neighbors planted it and it spread to more than an acre of a wooded area on his property, killing several trees, King said.
"It got down to the point that I thought every year I wouldn't have any more, and the next year I'd see a little sprig show up," said King, 78, who has lived on his 8-acre property for 50 years.
In neighboring Indiana, more than 159 kudzu sites have been reported in 39 counties, said Ken Cote of the state's Department of Natural Resources. Ohio State University Extension educators have found the plant climbing over old smokestacks in an industrial area outside of Cleveland.
"A while ago, most folks would have said it wouldn't survive in northern Ohio in the colder temperatures, but obviously it had," said Kathy Smith, the extension's director of forestry. "It will continue to spread as long as we aren't paying attention."

In the race for the U.S. Senate, incumbent Dick Durbin of Springfield, a Democrat, faces a challenge from former Lake County sheriff Mark Curran Jr. of Libertyville, a Republican. Three third-party candidates also share the ballot: philanthropist and businessman Willie Wilson of Chicago, Libertarian Danny Malouf of Crystal Lake and Green Party candidate David Black of Rockford. The Daily Herald asked the candidates to respond to a series of questions. David Black did not complete a questionnaire. 
To explore the candidates' campaign websites, visit durbinforsenate.com, electcurran.com, danny2020.com, williewilsonforsenate2020.com, and davidblackforsenate.org. Q. What has Donald Trump's unconventional leadership taught us about politics in the United States? What is the best thing his presidency has done? What is the most significant criticism you have of it? A. Donald Trump has failed to lead during one of the most critical periods in our lifetime. We have seen 200,000 American deaths from the pandemic, and millions more infected. Instead of listening to experts, President Trump criticized wearing masks; suggested people ingest cleaning chemicals; and he has failed to use the authorities available to him to mobilize to produce the equipment and testing necessary to save lives. The President has also failed on climate change, withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord and rolling back regulations. President Trump has failed to lead when it comes to addressing racial justice, voicing support for white supremacists. He has failed to lead on the global stage when it comes to failing to hold Russia's Vladimir Putin accountable, even while our own intelligence agencies have determined that Russia attacked our country by interfering in the 2016 election and Russia put bounties on the heads of U.S. soldiers. President Trump has failed to lead when it comes to his erratic trade policies that have hurt Illinois farmers. While I disagree with President Trump on most issues, I also worked with him to address criminal justice reform and reduce drug prices. Q. Many critics of governmental process complain that both Barack Obama and Donald Trump governed too much through executive orders rather than in collaboration with Congress. Is our system in danger of veering toward authoritarianism? From a structural standpoint, does Congress need to place stronger limits on the power of the presidency? If so, be specific on what some of those limits might be. If not, please explain your view. A. Americans deserve a Congress that legislates. Executive orders cannot meet the long-term needs that comprehensive legislation can. President Trump's executive orders to address the pandemic and the economic crisis are inadequate. He should work with Congress to pass the HEROES Act. I know too well the frustration with Congress failing to take action. I co-authored the DREAM Act, which was included in 2013 Comprehensive Immigration Reform legislation. This bipartisan legislation passed the Senate, but House Republican leadership refused to consider it. President Obama took executive action to create the DACA program to protect the Dreamers only after more than a decade of Congressional inaction. Congress's shortcomings under Republican leadership go beyond its refusal to legislate on a litany of important issues. For example, take the matter of declaring war. The Constitution designates this responsibility to Congress. Sending Americans to war should only be done with the consent of the people's elected representatives. And yet, Congress has abdicated this responsibility, sitting by as authorizations of force are stretched beyond credulity and military missions creep into nations never authorized by Congress. Congress must address the outdated authorizations of force for Afghanistan and for the war in Iraq, which I opposed. Q. Protesters have massed in the streets throughout America calling for greater social justice. How significant a role does systemic racism play in limiting equal opportunity in America? To the degree that it exists, what should be done about it? Do you favor reparations? Should police be "defunded?" A. We must recognize systemic racism wherever it exists. I worked with bipartisan partners to enact the most significant criminal justice reform legislation in a generation, the First Step Act. I also authored the Fair Sentencing Act, which lowered the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. I have worked to address racial disparities in maternal and infant mortality and to address the root causes of gun violence, such as a lack of economic opportunity in underserved areas. I co-sponsored Sen. Cory Booker's bill to establish a commission to study the impact of slavery and discrimination against African Americans and make recommendations on reparation proposals. We must use public safety resources in the most effective way possible. Police are performing roles that they often are not equipped for, such as handling mental illness crises. I support shifting some of those responsibilities and funding social services that are better trained to handle those situations. I co-sponsored the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would prohibit racial profiling, ban the use of chokeholds, require police to use dashboard and body cameras, and improve training. The bill also includes the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act, which would make lynching a federal crime. Q. Does today's climate of polarization reflect a natural and necessary ebb and flow in the tone of civic debate? Or does it reflect a dangerous divide? What, if anything, should be done about it? A. There's no doubt that the national dialogue has become increasingly polarized, and yes, hostile and even violent. When armed vigilantes are showing up to demonstrations and shooting people in the street, as we saw in Kenosha, or when people are driving cars into crowds of protesters, as we saw with the murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, it is clear that we have reached a dangerous point. President Donald Trump has stoked overtly violent rhetoric, and has encouraged white supremacist and other extreme forces. It is one of many reasons why he is unfit to lead this country, and why we must elect former Vice President Joe Biden in November. Q. Is there a "cancel culture" in America? A. What we've seen with heightened consciousness around racism, sexism and other forms of oppression, in concert with the rise of social media as a primary form of communication, is that individuals are more likely to be held publicly accountable for offensive or inappropriate statements. This is broadly a positive development that will hopefully lead people to be more careful with their word and deeds. Of course, there are challenges we must continue to grapple with in this new environment. Q. What do you see as the most important issues to address regarding immigration reform? If you oppose funding for a wall, what steps do you support to try to control illegal immigration? A. I oppose funding for the wall, but we should fund border security. I was part of the Gang of Six which authored comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform that passed the Senate, which would secure our border, protect American workers, and establish a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States. Unfortunately, the Republican House of Representatives would not call it for a vote. I hope that when we have a new President, we can protect Dreamers. I was the first one to introduce the DREAM Act in 2001 after being contacted by Thereza Lee - a young, undocumented women who was a musical prodigy and was brought to the United States when she was just two years old by her Korean parents. The DREAM Act would protect Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to America as children, from deportation and give them a chance to earn their U.S. citizenship. I urged President Obama to create the DACA program, which defers deportation for Dreamers for renewable, two-year periods. They did, and it's a fair and just system that Trump and his enablers keep trying to dismantle. Q. Please define your position on health care reform, especially as it relates to the Affordable Care Act. A. Health care should be a right afforded to everyone, not a privilege for the wealthy few. My vote for the Affordable Care Act was one of the most important I have taken. It brought health coverage to 20 million Americans, including more than 1 million in Illinois. It protected people with preexisting conditions, lowered prescription drug costs for seniors, allowed young people to stay on their parents' health plans through age 26, and required insurance companies to cover vital services such as maternity/newborn care, substance abuse treatment, doctors' visits and hospitalizations. Unlike congressional Republicans and President Trump - who are attempting to eliminate the Affordable Care Act - I believe we should do everything within our power to shore up the law. That means improving federal assistance to make health insurance more affordable for working families, expanding Medicaid, allowing all individuals the option of purchasing a private or public health insurance plan, ensuring better availability of dental and mental health care, and reducing the cost of prescription drugs. Q. Should everyone wear a mask? Should our schools be open? What has the country done right about the pandemic? What has it done wrong? How optimistic are you that we'll ever get back to "normal?" A. Everyone should wear a mask when in public. Decisions on school re-openings must be made at a local and state level, with input from administrators, teachers, public health experts and parents. Congress passed four bills to address the pandemic and the economic crisis. We must continue to invest in public health measures such as testing and contract tracing. Congress needs to ensure that families have financial support in the form of enhanced unemployment benefits. The Senate can pass the HEROES Act and provide funding for schools, extend unemployment, PPP, testing, tracing, and health care systems. Unfortunately, Senate Republican Leader McConnell has said he lacks urgency to pass another relief bill. President Trump dismissed the severity of the virus. He failed to develop a strategy for testing, contract tracing, or producing personal protective equipment, which resulted in PPE shortages and states competing against each other for resources. Had he taken this seriously, perhaps we would have been able to save lives and save jobs, as other countries have done. I am optimistic that, at some point, we will get back to normal. Our chances of doing so will be greatly increased if we elect Joe Biden. Q. What do you consider America's role in world affairs? What are we doing correctly to fill that role? What else should we be doing? A. Our world faces a host of challenges - from a pandemic and its economic consequences to climate change to destabilizing actors such as Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. These threats require international cooperation. President Trump has instead undermined our nation's credibility and ability to lead the international community, threatening our NATO alliance, walking away from international agreements, and denigrating our allies. He withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization in the middle of a pandemic. He started a reckless trade war with China that has hurt Illinois farmers. And he and his enablers have undermined the U.S. government institutions critical to foreign policy, leaving key vacancies unfilled, sidelining career professionals, and filling top positions with inexperienced political minions. America's strength around the world comes not just from the power of its military, but from the strengths of its ideals, values, and generosity - areas that have been tragically undermined by this administration. As such, we must lead by example, renew our partnerships, and reaffirm our role as a beacon of democracy and human rights. I have advocated for a strong NATO alliance, assistance to those most vulnerable around the world, and cooperation to stem nuclear proliferation and climate change. Q. Do you believe climate change is caused by human activity? What steps should government be taking to address the issue? A. The science is clear. Climate change is real, and human activity is causing increases in greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. This is one of the most significant crises we've faced. Unless we act soon, the entire world will experience the dire effects from the changing climate, which will continue to hit vulnerable populations hardest. We can't afford to leave this crisis for our children and grandchildren. Congress and the federal government need to implement a comprehensive clean electricity and transportation plan to reduce carbon emissions through regulations and investments to help transition the U.S. to a clean energy economy. I am a member of the Climate Action Task Force, where we're looking at ways to combat climate change. I introduced America's Clean Future Fund Act to establish an independent agency that would finance and spur the creation of U.S. jobs by investing in a clean energy economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and ensure a fair transition for those who work in fossil fuel sector jobs, and those who have been on the front lines of fossil fuel pollution and the impacts we are already facing from climate change. Q. What role does Congress play with regards to the growth of conspiracy theory groups like QAnon? A. QAnon is a fringe, conspiracy theory, which the FBI has warned is a domestic terrorism threat. The fact that President Donald Trump and many Republican leaders in Congress won't speak out against QAnon is embarrassing and dangerous. I have led efforts in Congress to address homegrown violent extremists. In January, I introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020, which would establish offices dedicated to combating this threat, require law enforcement to regularly assess the threat, and provide training and local resources to combat it. It's not enough to just condemn the rising prevalence of these organizations, we need to pass legislation equipping and empowering law enforcement to identify and combat domestic terrorism.

WASHINGTON - With melting glaciers and rising seas as his backdrop, President Barack Obama will visit Alaska next week to press for urgent global action to combat climate change, even as he carefully calibrates his message in a state heavily dependent on oil.
Obama will become the first sitting president to visit the Alaska Arctic when he travels to Kotzebue - population 3,153 - just north of the Arctic Circle at the end of his three-day trip. He'll kick off the visit Monday with a speech to a State Department-hosted conference on climate change and the Arctic.
The unambiguous goal of the president's trip is to use dramatic and alarming changes to Alaska's climate to instill fresh urgency into his global warming agenda. Sea ice is melting, critical permafrost is thawing and Alaska's cherished glaciers are liquefying - powerful visuals that Obama hopes will illustrate the threat to natural wonders and livelihoods and serve as a global call to action.
"This is all real," Obama said in his weekly address released Saturday. "This is happening to our fellow Americans right now."
Yet Obama has taken steps that show he's cautiously navigating the competing environmental and energy interests at play. A few weeks ago, his administration gave Royal Dutch Shell a final permit to drill into oil-bearing rock off Alaska's northwest coast for the first time in more than two decades.
"The president has made great strides in protecting the Arctic, but we are really disappointed with this decision," said Nicole Whittington-Evans, Alaska director for The Wilderness Society. "This is a point where we disagree."
For many Alaskans, though, the issue comes down to dollars and cents. Both the state government and its residents rely deeply on oil revenues to stay afloat, and falling oil prices have already created a serious budget deficit.
Brian Deese, Obama's senior adviser, sought to strike a balance between Alaska's economics needs and the president's goal to eventually phase out fossil fuels. "That's a transition that is not going to happen overnight," Deese said. In the meantime, he added, "oil and gas will remain important parts of our overall energy mix."
Ahead of Obama's visit, state Republican leaders emphasized the need for more energy development and urged Obama not to exploit the state's stunning scenery for political purposes. Sen. Dan Sullivan warned that any national or ocean monument designations "will go over like a lead balloon" among Alaska's Democrats and Republicans alike.
"What there's concern about is that he's going to use Alaska as some green screen for climate change, when he doesn't take the opportunity to dig into other issues that are important to Alaskans, important to the country," Sullivan said in an interview.
Obama has been investing time on an unfinished global climate treaty that nations hope to finalize in December, as he works to secure his environmental legacy before his presidency ends. The president has pledged a U.S. cut in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 28 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and plans to use the Alaska visit to build public pressure on other nations to commit to similarly ambitious measures.
After arriving in Anchorage on Monday afternoon, Obama plans to meet with Alaska Natives before addressing the Arctic climate resilience summit, dubbed GLACIER, which involves Arctic and non-Arctic leaders, scientists, environmental advocates and the energy industry. Secretary of State John Kerry, a key player in the climate treaty talks, also plans to speak.
In an unusual presidential photo-op, Obama will travel Tuesday to Seward, on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, where the Exit Glacier is retreating in what environmentalists say is a dramatic sign of warming temperatures. After hiking to the glacier, Obama is to board a U.S. Coast Guard vessel to tour Kenai Fjords National Park.
His visit continues Wednesday in Dillingham, in southwest Alaska, where Obama will meet with fishermen locked in an ongoing conflict with miners over plans to build a massive gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay, home to the world's largest salmon fishery. Then he'll fly north to Kotzebue, a regional hub in the Alaska Arctic, where Obama will focus on the plight of rural, native villages where livelihoods are threatened by encroaching climate change.
While in Alaska, Obama is likely to face calls from Democrats and environmentalists to restrict Arctic drilling and to renew his request to Congress to make more of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, off-limits as well. Republicans and energy advocates planned to urge the president to clear the way for more drilling.
Aside from brief campaign stops, few presidents have spent significant time in Alaska. President Warren Harding, shortly before his death in 1923, toured nine Alaska communities in three parts of the state.

'Bill Nye' doc takes on climate-change deniers

Bill Nye, the lanky, bow-tied TV science advocate, is still a hero to a generation of young adults who eagerly watched his 1990s series, "Bill Nye, the Science Guy," in classrooms or on afternoon television. The fast-paced, half-hour educational show made science fun, with hands-on experiments that kids could replicate at home. Nye also used such thrilling stunts as parasailing to demonstrate wind force, or explained the Earth's ecosystem while speeding down the road in a grass-covered car. 
Today, Nye still uses his unique brand of intellectual showmanship to highlight the importance of science, but as the documentary "Bill Nye: Science Guy" shows, he has shifted his focus from kids to grown-ups. At 61, Nye now wields his infectious enthusiasm to fight against climate-change denial. It's a fight that has brought him face to face with some prominent skeptics while also winning him legions of new fans and reinforcing the adoration of his old ones. In the documentary, we see Nye draw passionate crowds at his public appearances, where he's greeted like a sports star by raucous fans in a college auditorium or followed around, celebrity-style, at a conference for science teachers. Some people are eager to talk about their careers in science - all due to his influence, they say - and to snap photos with their idol. "I've been asked to talk about selfie fatigue," Nye jokes, catching his breath in an elevator. "I'm pretty sure it shortens your life." "Bill Nye" alternates compelling glimpses into Nye's psyche with an overview of his campaign to debunk high-profile climate-change deniers such as creationist Ken Ham. These encounters form the backbone of the film. Nye engages Ham, founder of the fundamentalist theme attraction Ark Encounter, in a spirited debate on climate change and global warming. He tours Ham's exhibitions, shaking his head and declaring that presenting dinosaurs as coexisting with humans constitutes "anti-science." The film also provides an eye-opening look at the private side of this public crusader. Nye cites his desire to leave the world better than he found it. Being childless, he says he's motivated by the idea that his work will be his legacy. But we also hear from a lifelong friend, who says that Nye "always wanted to be famous." Now that he is, his friends and colleagues - and Nye himself - consider how life in the spotlight has changed him. What hasn't changed is Nye's dogged determination to spread the gospel of science. During a college lecture a student asks him about strategies for connecting with science skeptics, and Nye responds: "Just keep talking. Draw them out, and ask why they believe (what they believe). Try to understand." Understanding has always been the cornerstone of Nye's work. "Bill Nye: Science Guy" offers an absorbing and entertaining portrait, of both the science evangelist and the guy behind him.
